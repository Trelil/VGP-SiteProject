St-aring Down

I'm st-aring down, down at you,
I'm staaaring down, like I can't take my eyes away
I'm al-ways watching, watching everything,
So there's aaalways no place I've overlooked
I'm st-aring down, down on your behavior,
I'm staaaring down, at the way you carry yourself
You've cl-utched on tight, it's already happened;
You've cluuutched and driven my heart mad...

I casually stumble upon you, and gaze with no intention
Then I notice how long it's been; time flies like an arrow

I'm searching, I'm digging around,
Touring through the history you've revealed
I'm stimulated, I'm absorbed,
A slave, no control, I'm being stolen away...

At skill far greater than expected from this world,
Praise, respect, I can only let out a sigh
It purifies me, I can see the future;
It saves me, I revere, I believe...

I'm st-aring down, down at you,
Like there's not a moment I can look away
I'm al-ways watching, watching everything,
So there's no nook or cranny I've overlooked
I'm st-aring down, down on your behavior,
That captivating, delicate way you carry yourself
You've cl-utched on tight, it's already happened;
In an instant, you've driven my heart mad...

I seek without tiring, I desire without limit,
I agonize without peace, my thoughts start to warp

I'm vexed, I become miserable;
I feel only impatience, jealousy
I have delusions, my thoughts run wild;
What more will you take from me?

For talent that shoots far above imagination,
There can be no match, I can only let out a sigh
I can see hope, or so I should see,
I should be saved, so then how can this be........

I want to see all with my limited field of sight,
And between your gaps engage in fight
The unseen world must have an endless view,
So I want to entrust it all to you
In the reality I pretend not to see,
"Look at me," for a stranger, is irrationality
I fear my senses will soon come back to me,
And my calmed self whispers quietly:

"They're just pixels..."

Taking advantage of low processing power, powerful, thieving - mere pixels
Relying on extreme imagination, expanding themselves - mere pixels
You who I st-ared down, pixels - what I al-ways watched, mere pixels
I've been cluuuuuuuuuutched so tightly; am I a lie? Real? Fictitious? True?

I see the pixels, I must be too close...
The pixels see me, I must be too far...
Common knowledge, what is it now?
Self-loathing, what is it now?

Like it was just a dream,
Suddenly I awaken, abruptly,
And close my eyes...
