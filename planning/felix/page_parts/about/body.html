	<p>
		Incredibly inaccurate artist's depiction. Except for the curls.

	<p>
		I'm vgperson, but you may call me vghime, Princess of the Vocaloid Kingdom. The v is lowercase. And the g. And the... you get the idea.
		I translate things, if you haven't noticed. I also do computery stuff and play video games. (Could one of these be related to my name? A mystery for the ages...)
	</p>
	<p>
		My Tumblr has a bunch of translations and other things not on my website.
		My YouTube channel is mostly for subtitled songs.
		My SoundCloud (old account) has a bunch of songs I made in PXtone.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to ask me something, you can ask me on Tumblr if you have one, or email vghimmel at gmail.
		Any other method of contact is playing a dangerous game (of probably never getting a reply).
	</p>
	<p>
		Please don't send me requests for song translations. If I want to do a song, I'll come across it myself.
		I also try to regularly look for games to translate and have passed on a lot of candidates, so I generally won't accept requests for those either.
		However, if you find a particularly good game which you think I've overlooked, you can try suggesting it.

		And last but not least: I am a boss!
