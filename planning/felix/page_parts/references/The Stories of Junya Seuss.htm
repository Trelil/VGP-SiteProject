<br>Man I am."

<br>Byakuren:
<br>"Human, I am, but a kind woman.
<br>I do not like that hateful Man."
<br>
<br>Man:
<br>"Would you kill a youkai, ma'am?"
<br>
<br>Byakuren:
<br>"I would not kill one, hateful Man.
<br>I care too much to say I can."
<br>
<br>Man:

<div id="catwiththehat" style="display: none">
<br>There was not any incident, and in boredom we lay,
<br>So Marisa came by, and we drank tea all day.
<br>But then something went SQUEAK! Oh, did that makes us freak!
<br>A rat darted out, and we nearly did shriek!
<br>Then we looked! And we saw her pounce on the rat!
<br>We looked! And we saw her! The Cat With the Hat!
<br>
<br>And she said to us, “Why do you sit there like that?
<br>We could play some danmaku,” said the Cat With the Hat.
<br>"I'm a brand new shikigami," said the Cat With the Hat.
<br>"I can use some fresh spellcards, and we'll have fun, at that."
<br>But Marisa and I did not know what to say.
<br>We were thinking this cat should just shoo, go away.
<br>
<br>"What's that look on your faces? Am I boring to you?
<br>In that case, here's a friend: Chen, of course, but Ran, too!"
<br>Then a Fox With Some Locks came and span from the sky,
<br>And of note, when she landed, she let out a sigh.
<br>"I know not why you sought to bug them some more,
<br>But you do have a point that today is a bore."
<br>
<br>"Now together, we'll play," said the Cat With the Hat.
<br>"And with Ran here, it may be I'll make you go splat!"
<br>But the battle was halted before it began,
<br>For a portal was opened before Chen and Ran.
<br>
<br>"So I nap for one second, and lo, what is that?
<br>You are crushing poor Nazrin, you silly, fat cat.
<br>You shall do no danmaku, you shall not do it here.
<br>Reimu's shrine would be ruined again, so I fear.
<br>If you say "but no incidents," I say you lie;
<br>The troubles you make in-between qualify."
<br>
<br>"For a master of borders," the magician quipped,
<br>"You sure do have issues keeping them whipped."
<br>And the gap youkai glared: "Do shut up for my pleasure,
<br>Else I rip out your tongue and your spare for good measure."
<br>
<br>So the Cat With the Hat and the Fox With Some Locks
<br>Went away in the gap with the Girl With the Cap.
<br>And Marisa remarked, "Geez, all that from a mouse.
<br>Well, I'm still pretty bored. I'mma blow up their house."

<font id="size3"><a href="javascript:%20s('satoristoleshinto')" title="How the Grinch Stole Christmas!">How Satori Stole Shinto</a></font><br>
<div id="satoristoleshinto" style="display: none">
<br>In Gensokyo, they had followed Shinto an age...
<br>But Satori beneath them could not hold her rage!
<br>Satori despised it! The whole Shinto shebang!
<br>And it wasn't just 'cause she cared not for yin-yangs.
<br>No, she hated the cycle, the Hakurei way,
<br>That led human and youkai to fight every day!
<br>Yet they seemed to enjoy it! And yet she knew not why!
<br>But one day, she decided she'd kiss it goodbye!
<br>
<br>So she sat in her bunk, and she thunk, and she thunk,
<br>'Til she got an idea so awful it stunk!
<br>"What a glorious plan!" And to her work she ran,
<br>And she made the most maidenly garb in Japan!
<br>So adorned in the outfit, all frilly and sleeved,
<br>She was sure even Marisa would be deceived!
<br>
<br>"All I need is a turtle" - but Satori was stumped,
<br>For that was a hurdle not easily jumped.
<br>Would Satori give up? No, there's story to go!
<br>"You can walk on all fours, can't you now, Utsuho?!"
<br>
<br>So she rode to the shrines, Moriya, Hakurei,
<br>And she wrecked them as good at she could before day.
<br>She broke into all houses, from shack to chateau,
<br>And she pilfered from them every ruffle and bow.
<br>
<br>But just as she went to the mountaintop peak,
<br>She heard an emerger from the underground speak.
<br>"Satori? And Okuu? Hey, what's with your clothes?
<br>You're leaving me out of some fun, I suppose?"
<br>And she was glad Koishi closed her third eye,
<br>For it made it quite easy to tell her this lie:
<br>"Oh, sister, you've caught me like such a buffoon.
<br>We were just doing cosplay, we'll be back home soon."
<br>
<br>Koishi was convinced (for her sister WAS weird),
<br>So Satori could finish with no more to fear.
<br>With adornments in tow (with, of course, names that rhymed),
<br>Slowly but surely the mountain she climbed.
<br>It was finally dawn by the time she was done;
<br>She had view of the land of the old rising sun.
<br>
<br>"Oh-hoh to Gensokyo!" she lazily yawned.
<br>"They're finding out now that their Shinto is gone!
<br>They're just waking up! I know just what they'll feel!
<br>Their hearts will be saddened, they'll get down and kneel!
<br>And both human and youkai will lamentably SQUEAL!
<br>Those are hearts," grinned Satori, "that I simply must hear!"
<br>So she paused, and made sure her third eye could see clear.
<br>
<br>And she did feel their thoughts coming over the land.
<br>And they came to expand, they turned ever so grand...
<br>But the thoughts were not sad! Why, they were of good cheer!
<br>It couldn't be so! They must all have had BEER!
<br>She glared at Gensokyo! Satori's eyes popped!
<br>And she saw such a sight that it made her heart drop!
<br>
<br>Every human and youkai, magician and fairy,
<br>They continued their roles, they continued them merry!
<br>She HADN'T stopped Shinto's recurring! IT WENT!
<br>In Gensokyo's ways, she had not made a dent!
<br>And Satori, left feeling awestruck and aghast,
<br>Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How can it still last?
<br>It goes without gohei?! It goes without bows?!
<br>It goes without ribbons, parasols, crows?!"
<br>
<br>She puzzled and puzzled 'til she'd near lost her mind.
<br>Then Satori thought something to which she'd been blind.
<br>"Maybe Shinto," she thought, "doesn't come from a shrine.
<br>Maybe Shinto, perhaps... isn't theirs, hers, or mine!"
<br>And what happened then? In Gensokyo they say
<br>That Satori's third eye opened three winks that day.
<br>
<br>So she hurried to bring back all that which she'd stole,
<br>And made sure that all youkai were left joyous souls.
<br>And once done, Satori went back under to pray...
<br>But Sanae awoke, and there was hell to pay.

<font id="size3"><a href="javascript:%20s('tenshitheangel')" title="Yertle the Turtle">Tenshi the Angel</a></font><br>
<div id="tenshitheangel" style="display: none">
<br>In the sky far above, in a heavenly realm,
<br>Tenshi the Angel thought herself at the helm.
<br>A nice little place. It was joyous and fun.
<br>And so high in the sky, it of course got much sun.
<br>The Celestials had all Celestials could ask.
<br>And in this utopia, they eternally basked.
<br>
<br>Tenshi, though, was not so; she found all of it dull.
<br>It was perfectly boring her out of her skull.
<br>"I'm better," said Tenshi, "than all who I know.
<br>But the problem, you see, is my proving it's so.
<br>With this Keystone, I can cause some earthquakes, it's true,
<br>But to seem as if that's all I've got shall not do.
<br>The people below take me far, far too lightly.
<br>I shall tower above, just as I deserve rightly!
<br>If I could do that, oh, what might I'd command!
<br>Both the queen of the heavens and all of the land!"
<br>
<br>So Tenshi the Angel went down to the ground,
<br>And she bellowed her order, a deafening sound.
<br>She forced all of the fairies and spirits and crows
<br>To build her a throne that up to heaven rose.
<br>Since they had no material, their selves formed a stack.
<br>Tenshi climbed to the top one and sat on her back.
<br>
<br>"I can see," Tenshi cried, "all the land from this seat!
<br>Every human and youkai whom I could soundly beat!
<br>I'm the queen of Gensokyo, and this, they all know,
<br>For I am so high, and they are so low!"
<br>
<br>And all through the day, she chuckled with glee:
<br>"Not a girl in Gensokyo can come above me!"
<br>And indeed it was true - at least, they did not try.
<br>But down from the bottom, there came a low sigh.
<br>"What's that?" yelled the angel, snapped out of her daze.
<br>And a turtle named Genji turned upward his gaze.
<br>At the bottom he sat, and he said, "Tenshi, Queen,
<br>I should think that by now, what you seek, you have seen."
<br>
<br>For a moment, Queen Tenshi was taken aback.
<br>"Shut your mouth! You will stay at the base of my stack!
<br>What nerve of a turtle to be questioning me!
<br>He belongs at the bottom - a dimwit is he!
<br>What I seek," she proclaimed, "is to reach to the skies!
<br>Then both heaven and earth will be plain to my eyes!
<br>You can surely bring more! Make my throne higher still!
<br>I rule all that exists, and all that ever will!"
<br>
<br>"I see nothing to you that proves power at all,
<br>But a Keystone that would, in fact, make your throne fall.
<br>And your throne, it means naught, it is easily beat:
<br>One must simply do this." Genji moved his old feet.
<br>With this minuscule act, the throne shook and it swayed,
<br>And the Queen's loudest shouts could not stop the cascade.
<br>As the stack, it unstacked, Tenshi fell on her crown,
<br>And was once again Chiko, queen of the ground.

<div id="hellsformerstreets" style="display: none">
<br>When Suika leaves the underground, she always bids farewell,
<br>And adds, "If you see something cool, next time I'm here, do tell."
<br>But when I do just what I'm told, she scoffs, "You make my day!"
<br>She thinks it's all a fairy tale, I've had too much sake.
<br>But things are really happening here - well, when the time is right.
<br>These WERE the former streets of hell, where oni roamed all night.
<br>
<br>And one night I was pacing before Suika came,
<br>And I thought to myself, oh, now this is a shame!
<br>There is nothing a-happening, not but one little thing,
<br>But a fairy a-fluttering with its tiny wings.
<br>
<br>I can't tell Suika that, she'll just think I'm a bore!
<br>I know for a fact she'll expect something more!
<br>But I can tell a lie, I can do that quite well:
<br>At the least, I can say it was Cirno in hell.
<br>
<br>Though what business had she to be wandering here?
<br>Well, of course, hell was cold around this time of year.
<br>And the reason for that? Well, if you didn't know,
<br>Cirno's best of friends Letty was calling up snow.
<br>Yes, an incident came! Hell with snowballs and sleet!
<br>And to think that I saw that on hell's former streets!
<br>
<br>Now that's odd, to think Letty would do such a thing.
<br>Why would she go to hell to bring winter in spring?
<br>Well, she said she was sent here by Yuyuko, see,
<br>And it came to relate to the Ayakashi.
<br>She wanted it cold here - and this is a hoot -
<br>So there'd be plenty water to give to its roots!
<br>
<br>Well, of course such an incident couldn't last long.
<br>Reimu set out to settle for good this great wrong.
<br>And on top of all that - and I say this with pride -
<br>It was Mima herself who fought at Reimu's side!
<br>But it was not so simple! It was almost a war!
<br>With a polar bear youkai, a naga, and more!
<br>
<br>And where did they come from? Well, I've got news for you!
<br>That Yuyuko brought youkai from Former Hell Two!
<br>Did you know that existed? No, neither did I!
<br>And believe it or not, it is found in the sky!
<br>It would seem the Celestials and they always fought,
<br>So she offered - Yuyuko - to borrow the lot.
<br>
<br>Such an intricate plot, but that's not quite the end!
<br>There was yet one more person behind this, my friend.
<br>Orchestrating this plot with the thinnest of silk
<br>Was Yukari Yakumo and all of her ilk.
<br>And as for HER intentions, who can possibly tell?
<br>I just saw what I did on these old streets of hell!
<br>
<br>What a story I've spun! Suika'll sure get a rise!
<br>But I looked up and gasped - it was before my eyes!
<br>Yes, old Letty was here and was bringing a blizzard,
<br>And Reimu fought onward with Mima the wizard!
<br>The pair struggled on against Yuyu's resolve,
<br>And I knew the Yakumo just MUST be involved!
<br>Then I heard Suika coming! And I shouted, "Hey, sis!
<br>You won't trust it from me - you have GOTTA see THIS!"

<div id="thetouhous" style="display: none">
<br>In all of Gensokyo, I am sure you will find
<br>That the brilliantest brain of them all, it is mine!
<br>I've been treated quite poorly, been stomped on a few,
<br>But I say I'm the strongest because it is TRUE!
<br>
<br>And although I'm the smartest, at times I do wonder:
<br>Do I put it to use? Oh, my ultimate blunder!
<br>So rather than leaving my mind on the shelf,
<br>I think I'll go ahead and make Touhou myself!
<br>
<br>Touhou Thirteen Point Nine! Starring, naturally, me!
<br>It will be the best game that you ever did see!
<br>First I'll make all the music, the catchiest tunes,
<br>Though it may take some tiny assistance from ZUN.
<br>But I know he would surely comply with a laugh;
<br>Any lad would be glad to be on Cirno's staff!
<br>
<br>But what makes it so great? Why, I'm glad that you asked!
<br>Just one part is the replay - my game, it will LAST!
<br>Twenty stages at least, but there could be some more,
<br>For who knows what designs my great mind has in store!
<br>And above Lunatic, there'll be For Utter Loons;
<br>Well, or not. I might leave that one all up to ZUN.
<br>
<br>So the story, of course, will be epic in scale!
<br>It won't be what you think when you think "fairy tale."
<br>Filled with riddles and intrigue, betrayal, deceit,
<br>I'll have all the great writers bow down at my feet!
<br>ZUN will help me, although, on some of the facts,
<br>As I trust he'll be just fine with having my back.
<br>
<br>But now that's just the first game! Just you wait for the sequel,
<br>Which my first magnum opus itself could not equal!
<br>Every girl from all games will come back to assist,
<br>Fitting right into place with this game's turns and twists!
<br>And such wowing danmaku you can just barely graze...
<br>Every second of gameplay will prove to amaze!
<br>
<br>So how much would you love it? What was that? You said "very"?
<br>Ah yes, nary a fairy would say the contrary!
<br>But it did slip my mind, magnifique as it is,
<br>That this game of my dreams could not come to exist!
<br>I don't know how to program, as I've often lamented,
<br>For computers are something that've not been invented!
<br>And it's sad to admit that yes, I am not real,
<br>So while ZUN can create, I have only my zeal.
<br>But if you're out there, oh! All the things you can do!
<br>So if you want this game... then you're counting on you!

<font id="size3"><a href="javascript:%20s('theyorax')" title="The Lorax">The Yorax</a></font><br>
<div id="theyorax" style="display: none">
<br>In the village, before it was hidden to history,
<br>There were tales that spoke of a curious mystery.
<br>It was once, so they claimed, that a girl there would roam
<br>On the land where these humans now put up their homes.
<br>She was known as the Yorax, but one day she was gone,
<br>And without her, the humans, well, they just moved on.
<br>
<br>But who WAS the Yorax? And why was she there?
<br>And why did it seem she had vanished somewhere,
<br>And why did the humans, well, not even care?
<br>If you wanted to know, just as one person did,
<br>You could ask the great Akyu, even though she's a kid.
<br>
<br>Akyu sat for a bit with her guest for some tea,
<br>Then she tried to begin: "Well, if you're asking me,
<br>I can tell you the things I saw some time ago,
<br>And if I did that, it would go something like so..."
<br>
<br>Way back in the days when this town was not here,
<br>It was youkai that roamed there, and that was quite clear.
<br>There were countlessly many, and countlessly kinds.
<br>And they loved having fun. That was all on their minds.
<br>Not all started off well, but they'd soon get on great.
<br>They would never let fun fall victim to hate.
<br>
<br>But the humans, you know, they just grow and they grow,
<br>And they'll just keep on growing wherever they go.
<br>So one day I was with some, and we found the spot,
<br>And the others exclaimed, "We'll bring more here! A lot!"
<br>But I watched and thought, "not with these youkai, we're not."
<br>
<br>Alas, humans are clever, and get what they seek.
<br>There were quite a lot more of us there in a week.
<br>We had made an agreement for part of the land,
<br>Thanks in part to some gifts which we'd made them by hand.
<br>But the youkai were not quite as quick to agree
<br>When the other side - ours - cut away all the trees.
<br>
<br>The youkai, in truth, only humored the deal
<br>So we humans would bring them a great human meal.
<br>That we borrowed and so quickly ravaged their land
<br>Was an act which the youkai would not just let stand.
<br>
<br>But before they began on their preemptive snack,
<br>Their leader, the Yorax, told them to hold back.
<br>She discussed with the humans and firmly assured
<br>That they would do no more, and stay true to that word.
<br>So the deal went on for a little bit longer...
<br>During which time the humans, they only grew stronger.
<br>
<br>With just part of the land and no right to cut wood,
<br>The humans soon filled it as much as they could.
<br>We would have to find some way to fit both combined,
<br>But the Yorax had quite different plans in her mind.
<br>Now was time for the feast - something we also knew.
<br>And although it was vile, we knew what we would do.
<br>
<br>On that night, youkai died, in twos and in threes,
<br>And the humans cared not if they shot any trees.
<br>"What are you fiends DOING?!", we heard poor Yorax shout;
<br>"We shall never forgive you! Get OUT, OUT, OUT, <b>OUT!</b>"
<br>
<br>Yorax fought for her fallen all throughout the night,
<br>But against our assault, it was not a fair fight.
<br>She was forced to abscond, and she vanished for good,
<br>Leaving humans to clear out the rest of the wood.
<br>
<br>"After that," Akyu sighed, "I can tell you no more."
<br>Then she slowly looked up. "Well, unless, of course, <i>you're...</i>"
<br>Her guest there was smiling, and smiling quite wide.
<br>Though sad, Akyu's story had warmed her inside.
<br>
<br>"It is good that you say that. Yes, it is good,
<br>There is one who remembers that this was once wood.
<br>So there <i>was</i> one among you who noticed their ways...
<br>I feared that there would not be by the end of my days."
<br>The Yorax stood up and said, "You will soon know
<br>How the story of "Yorax" leads into "Yakumo."
<br>And this story is one that will soon come to grow
<br>When a new land develops: a "Gensokyo.""

<div id="houraisanhatches" style="display: none">
<br>Sighed Aya, who stared at the newly-laid eggs,
<br>"Owning crows is quite nice, but this part is the dregs!
<br>I've got so much reporting and shooting to do,
<br>How could I spare the time to just sit here and stew?
<br>Who would waste all that time? No, I'm serious, who?"
<br>
<br>She went asking around to see who could do best,
<br>But not even the phoenix would sit on no nest.
<br>And yet as luck would have it - if you would call it luck -
<br>In the very same forest, opportunity struck.
<br>
<br>"Hello, Princess Kaguya!" Aya said brightly,
<br>"I had heard you came 'round about these parts near-nightly.
<br>So I thought I would ask you if you would take these -"
<br>And she shouted, "That's perfect! I'll buy them, uh, please!"
<br>Aya paused, but for yen, she would never refuse,
<br>So she sold the whole load to the princess recluse.
<br>
<br>Houraisan took them home and was ready to cook,
<br>But before she got cracking, took a more careful look.
<br>"These look weird," she observed, "I'm not sure these are right.
<br>At the least, they're not like what I saw on that site."
<br>So she researched some more and she soon came to know,
<br>"Holy bullets! These eggs look like eggs from a crow!"
<br>
<br>"That's DISGUSTING!" she spat. "Aya sold me her KIDS?!
<br>Or does she even lay eggs...? Oh geez, god forbid.
<br>But the point is, if she wants these hatched, I'm no mom!
<br>They can't teach me to parent on answers.com!"
<br>But she figured at that point that she was quite stuck.
<br><i>No one</i> wanted the job - she just had the worst luck.
<br>
<br>"But how DO I hatch egg?" She puzzled a bit.
<br>"I'm an expert at sitting, but that can't be quite it...
<br>And even if it is, I'm just me, and there's tons!
<br>I'm having such trouble before I've even begun..."
<br>
<br>So she went to ask Reisen if she could lend help,
<br>But she shook her head solemnly, muttering "Welp...
<br>All an egg really needs is some warmth, I suppose,
<br>But just right, and consistent. So... so much for those crows."
<br>
<br>She was saddened - no reason to be so attached,
<br>But she'd thought up good names to give each when they hatched.
<br>Once returned to her room, she was given a scare:
<br>She looked for the eggs here, but she found them down there.
<br>Down there... with her laptop... which radiated heat!
<br>"Then... AHA! The job's perfect for the life of a NEET!"
<br>
<br>The princess pried open her main tower's case,
<br>And inside, each egg, labeled, was lovingly placed.
<br>She modded a hole for the young crows to flee,
<br>And for quite a few months, she could just let it be.
<br>
<br>And she did, but one night, Eientei was quite loud,
<br>So she went out to see what was causing the crowd.
<br>New earth rabbits were birthed, which was no special thing...
<br>But the babies had hatched, and they all had black wings.
<br>Tewi watched with amazement as they flew through the sky,
<br>And then she saw Kaguya. "Um, ahaha... hi?"
<br>
<br>Reisen knew the moon princess, and knew her plan'd flop,
<br>So she sent stealthy rabbits to make a quick swap.
<br>The eggs were raised right while Kaguya's fakes burned...
<br>Though the crow-rabbit babies were cause for concern.
<br>Kaguya took this in, then exclaimed with a shout:
<br>"Well, I think NOW I get what that "Easter"'s about!"

<div id="mcscarlet" style="display: none">
<br>"You must think you're one real special snowflake
<br>If you think you can catch something new in that lake!"
<br>Cirno sat there annoyed: "Oh, you shut your mouth, Dai!
<br>Here's a lake, I've a rod! So why shouldn't I try?!
<br>I mean sure, all the fish I've seen aren't all that tasty,
<br>But I had an idea, so don't be so hasty..."
<br>
<br>I may live on this lake, but I've never gone deep.
<br>And if deep it does go, who knows WHAT down there sleeps?
<br>(Though since it's by the mansion, that gives me the creeps...)
<br>So what lies down below, well, we can't say for sure!
<br>You still think I'm a fool to have let down my lure?
<br>
<br>And if we don't know that, then what else don't we know?
<br>The extent of this lake might not be Gensokyo!
<br>It must connect somewhere, so it occurred to me,
<br>And where else could that be but the great big blue sea!
<br>Fish could cross the great border just to hook on my line!
<br>And I'd have quite a feast! Why, for weeks I could dine!
<br>
<br>"And with all the world's oceans a-headed my way,
<br>I could catch brand new species! Who knows what I may?
<br>Like sunfish... and blue fish... and red fish... and oarfish?"
<br>Cirno's creative skills had always been poorish.
<br>
<br>"Yeah, whatever you say," Daiyousei sneered.
<br>"I'm sure they're just hiding, and have been for years."
<br>Cirno folded her arms, and mumbled, "I guess..."
<br>Dai was right - but that she was wrong, she'd not confess.
<br>But she said, though aware she was likely mistaken,
<br>"Well, when I catch a catfish, we'll see who's the one shaken!"

<font id="size3"><a href="javascript:%20s('bighearted')" title="Thidwick the Big-Hearted Moose">Reimu the Big-Hearted Maiden</a></font><br>
<div id="bighearted" style="display: none">
<br>At the Hakurei Shrine, near the border or so,
<br>Lives the shrine maiden Reimu, I'm sure you must know.
<br>And she sits there all day and she sips on her tea
<br>Just as long as there's no sign of calamity.
<br>
<br>Often Suika comes by, as she did on this day,
<br>And she's gladly permitted, whenever, to stay.
<br>Reimu would be hard-pressed to dare turn down a guest,
<br>Plus she does enjoy company, even from pests.
<br>
<br>So this day, Suika said, "Since you're really so kind,
<br>Between downing my sake, a thought came to mind.
<br>It's all well and good drinking in peace here with you,
<br>But I've got a few friends who I'm sure'd like to too."
<br>Reimu knew this would end ill, and come at great price.
<br>But she did not refuse. As was said, she's too nice.
<br>
<br>So a little bit later, Yuugi came on around.
<br>And she gasped, "Man, there's nothing like this underground!"
<br>It's not anything fancy, Reimu honestly thought.
<br>But she'd let her guests use it, palace or not.
<br>After several drinks' time, Yuugi had this to say:
<br>"So I talked about this to some friends on the way..."
<br>And that's when Reimu KNEW she would have a bad day.
<br>
<br>First came a spider who webbed up the walls,
<br>Then a kappa who lived near the base of the falls.
<br>Aya brought crows in murders that blocked out the sun,
<br>Which allowed Mistress Scarlet to come have some fun.
<br>Next was Tewi, then Unzan, then Orange, then Chen...
<br>Reimu knew she would not let this happen again.
<br>
<br>She looked on at the fully-packed shrine, still in awe,
<br>But when Cirno came over, she brought the last straw:
<br>"I heard this was a party, and to bring all my buds!
<br>So can these guys -" Then fairies arrived in a flood.
<br>
<br>Reimu fled from the crowd - how could she set THIS right?
<br>She would have to find somewhere to stay for the night.
<br>But a figure in black, in the sky, in the dark,
<br>Flew above her and shouted, "Aha! MASTER SPARK!"
<br>
<br>So the party was crashed, and Marisa was pleased,
<br>Although when she saw Reimu, for a moment, she freezed.
<br>Reimu, though, was just fine with her now-collapsed shrine;
<br>You should be kind to <i>guests,</i> but not so much to swine.

<font id="size3"><a href="javascript:%20s('alicehears')" title="Horton Hears A Who!">Alice Hears A Doll!</a></font><br>
<div id="alicehears" style="display: none">
<br>In a hut hidden deep in the Forest of Magic,
<br>A magician named Alice lived a life somewhat tragic.
<br>She was never too good at making new friends;
<br>She always had trouble keeping up on her end.
<br>This being the case, at most times, though not all,
<br>She would rather stay in and would talk to her dolls.
<br>
<br>Alice knew this was odd, but she didn't care, much.
<br>She was mostly just gleaning amusement from such.
<br>To imagine that they were alive was her play,
<br>But that's not to say she didn't treat them that way.
<br>She would stand for one thing, and she'd stand for it tall:
<br>"A person's a person, but so is a doll!"
<br>
<br>And one day, when she stayed inside once more, by choice,
<br>Alice thought she was hearing a faintly-heard voice.
<br>She glanced all 'round the room, and her interest was piqued
<br>By a new Shanghai doll - one that seemed it could speak!
<br>"I'm not sure why her voice is so terribly small,
<br>But this doll seems more person than any and all!"
<br>
<br>Alice checked the doll over, and too her own ears.
<br>It was motionless, yes, but its speaking was clear.
<br>"I can't make out if she's asking any requests,
<br>But at least, I should treat her as one of my guests!"
<br>And treat her she did, with crumpets and tea,
<br>Which Marisa observed from behind a large tree.
<br>
<br>"What is WRONG with that girl? Having tea with a puppet?!
<br>If she's really that nuts, I should take and blow up it!"
<br>So when Alice grew tired, and bid her guest good night,
<br>The witch snuck in and pilfered all Shanghais in sight.
<br>And as she flew back home, she dropped dolls in a trail,
<br>Which she knew her friend Alice would see without fail.
<br>
<br>Alice woke up an hour or five after dawn,
<br>But then shouted, alarmed: "Ahh! The doll! Where's she GONE?!"
<br>So she hurried on outside in search of her guest,
<br>And then noticed the Shanghais. "And there's all the rest!
<br>Some fiend must have come to abduct that poor doll!
<br>But... Which one of these is it?! I can't check them all!"
<br>
<br>But in no time, she realized a fact that brought calm:
<br>"All of MY dolls, not that one, will light like a bomb!"
<br>So she lit every one, let the gunpowder blow;
<br>It was kind of a waste, though she saved all the bows.
<br>(And no, no trees were harmed. She's quite careful, you know.)
<br>
<br>By the time she had blown up near every last one,
<br>She had realized the path along which the dolls run.
<br>So she figured it better to skip to the witch,
<br>And just ask her herself why she'd been such a... snitch.
<br>
<br>There Marisa was waiting, and Alice began:
<br>"Why'd you steal my dolls? What on earth is your plan?!"
<br>"Why did you <i>blow them up?</i>" the black witch thought to say,
<br>But she wanted to make her intent clear as day.
<br>"Look, I'm so sorry, Alice. To have fooled you was folly.
<br>See, that "talking doll" is -" "Medicine Melancholy?!"
<br>
<br>"What? No, that'd be dumb, and fairly inane.
<br>What the truth is is, well... a bit hard to explain.
<br>There's these things Kourin has that can play back a sound,
<br>And I got quite a thought (for which I'm so renowned).
<br>I recorded some lines which I thought'd do the deed,
<br>And disguised it with one of those Unknown Form Seeds!"
<br>
<br>"Uh, I get HALF of that," she said, in disarray,
<br>"But what "deed" do you mean? What words did you say?"
<br>"Here's a few I remember..." Marisa replied:
<br>"Alice, make friends!" "Alice, please go outside!"
<br>"It's all well and good having some fun with a doll,
<br>But a PERSON's a person... and that's about all!"
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>"Aw, well, you could've just ASKED..."

<font id="size3"><a href="javascript:%20s('hadincidents')" title="I Had Trouble in Getting To Solla Sollew">I Had Incidents Heading On My Way to Tea</a></font><br>
<div id="hadincidents" style="display: none">
<br>I was having a pretty good day at the shrine,
<br>But I didn't have too much to do with my time.
<br>I heard Reimu would sometimes invite over friends,
<br>But since everyone's pals, I knew how THAT would end.
<br>Then Suwako came up and brought good news to me,
<br>That Yukari'd invited a choice few to tea.
<br>
<br>While I questioned why she couldn't gap her guests there,
<br>I headed on out, but my question was, where?
<br>I had heard "Mayohiga," or else "on the border,"
<br>But I wanted directions - those did not fill the order.
<br>How to reach either place, I knew nothing about,
<br>So I guessed it'd be best to just keep heading... out.
<br>
<br>As I flew, I asked passersby, what might they know?
<br>But my flight was disturbed by a stray UFO!
<br>Well, "stray" isn't quite right; in the blink of an eye,
<br>A strange alien riding a whole fleet zoomed by!
<br>I was dazed, and I knew that SOME thing was afoot,
<br>But I had tea to catch - out of mind, it was put.
<br>
<br>Then I heard quite a fight stirring in the bamboo;
<br>It seemed Mokou was having an incident too!
<br>I had flown quite a ways and was starting to tire,
<br>But had no time to rest - since I got set on fire.
<br>As I stopped, dropped, and rolled (after quite a high drop),
<br>Mokou swore she was sorry, though the fight didn't stop.
<br>
<br>Once recovered from that, I was in Eientei,
<br>Which is NOT where to be if you don't know your way.
<br>I pushed on through rabbits and a few rabbit-crows...
<br>I don't want to know what was the story with those.
<br>After all of that hassle, I was sure I'd be late,
<br>But regardless, I turned "out" and flew ahead straight.
<br>
<br>Though I got somewhat lost (yes, along a straight line),
<br>I at last found the maiden of our rival shrine.
<br>She asked me what business I had near the border,
<br>As she was just getting her own things in order.
<br>So I told her I had been invited for tea,
<br>But she looked at me puzzled, which too puzzled me.
<br>
<br>To her knowledge, she said, I had NOT been invited;
<br>She supposed I just heard it and got too excited.
<br>And she didn't stay long, she did not have all day;
<br>She ran into some incidents too on her way.
<br>
<br>So I felt quite defeated, as anyone would,
<br>But at least I came back to tea almost as good.
<br>So yes, incidents happened - that's what incidents do.
<br>They could happen to her, or to me, or to you.
<br>But I made up my mind as I put down my tea...
<br>Soon those incidents all would have trouble with me!
<br>
</div>
<br>

<font id="size3"><a href="javascript:%20s('fairyfracas')" title="The Butter Battle Book">The Fairy Fracas Fable</a></font><br>
<div id="fairyfracas" style="display: none">
<br>I saw three fairies scurrying while I was out;
<br>When they caught sight of me, though, they gave me a shout.
<br>"Little rain fairy, run! It's not safe here for you!"
<br>But I just had to ask them - "Huh? What did you do?"
<br>
<br>"What did we DO?!" the sun fairy gawked.
<br>"For some puddle-y fairy, you're sure one to talk!
<br>Look, I know we're mischievous, but who ever said
<br>That we couldn't be minding our business instead?!"
<br>But the moon fairy cut in: "We HAVE done a wrong.
<br>Let's find somewhere to hide, for this might get quite long..."
<br>
<br>Now, you may be aware of the Great Fairy "War,"
<br>Though its fighters, in total, came out to just four.
<br>As a war amongst fairies, 'twas quickly resolved;
<br>Things worked out quite well for all parties involved.
<br>Yes, we ended up being some pretty good pals.
<br>(The war did not terribly tax our morales.)
<br>
<br>But a fairy's a fairy, there's no changing that.
<br>We could not just be friends who at times liked to chat.
<br>We still had to be rivals. And as rivals, we fought,
<br>Just a fun spellcard battle each night - so we thought.
<br>
<br>Though when tasked with revenge Cirno beat us down flat,
<br>When just fighting for fun, she could not come near that.
<br>So when once, she produced a tough fireball card,
<br>To suppose there was foul play afoot was not hard.
<br>While she ended up winning, we'd not let it stand,
<br>And we found that Patchouli had lent her a hand.
<br>
<br>But as fairies, we figured some foul play was good;
<br>We would just do it BETTER than her, that we would.
<br>We split up and sweet-talked the youkai we knew,
<br>And simple as that, their attacks were ours too.
<br>So in no time, a bounty of spellcards we'd won,
<br>Thus proving three fairies were better than one.
<br>
<br>Yet when time came to battle, our jaws hit the floor;
<br>Cirno had all our spellcards! And plus a few more!
<br>It was closer than last time, but we still could not win;
<br>All our effort was wasted, much to our chagrin.
<br>
<br>But Star had an idea, which she told with aplomb;
<br>She knew the best way to prove we were the bomb!
<br>All the youkai we'd pilfered were more or less tame,
<br>And since Cirno had our stuff, she'd talked to the same.
<br>But to beat her, we'd go where no fairy dared go...
<br>We would steal the spellcards right off Utsuho!
<br>
<br>And we did. It was harrowing, that's all I'll say.
<br>But the story for that must be some other day.
<br>
<br>So tonight, as we readied our nuclear sun,
<br>We were shocked once again to see two, not just one!
<br>Cirno had the same cards! She had done it again!
<br>We knew something was really and truly up, then!
<br>"We gave all of our might to find spellcards this rare!
<br>Why do you have our cards?! That's BEYOND just "not fair"!"
<br>
<br>"Unlike you," Cirno gloated, "I've got brains with my brawn!
<br>There was only one youkai I needed to con!
<br>Just Satori! She taught me, and I learned it fast!
<br>I can COPY your worst!" she revealed at last.
<br>We were livid. She snickered, "Be careful! Oh, gee!
<br>Who's going to throw it?! Will <i>I</i>... or will -" "<i>WE!</i>"
<br>
<br>And whoever suggested the Forest of Magic...
<br>Well, THAT was a move turned decidedly tragic.
<br>As ill timing would have it, the witch had a guest.
<br>It was Mima, in fact - a fact we can attest,
<br>For once our sun blew up, the two came from the wreck,
<br>And they swore with a shout they'd be having our necks!
<br>
<br>"That's why you must run," Luna finished the tale.
<br>"Yes, we're hiding, but likely it's to no avail!
<br>We've gotten them angry! For death we've been marked!
<br>So get going before they use twin Master Spar -"

<br>

<font id="size3"><a href="javascript:%20s('fivehundredhats')" title="The 500 Hats of Batholomew Cubbins">The 500 Hats of Rinnosuke Morichika</a></font><br>
<div id="fivehundredhats" style="display: none">
<br>Rinnosuke was bored. No one came by the store.
<br>Just to open and close it each day seemed a chore.
<br>He was not too sure why; even mayhap his wares
<br>Were thought too commonplace, at least males were rare.
<br>In the end, he decided his problem was that
<br>Unlike all of the girls, he did not have a hat.
<br>
<br>Now, just getting a hat would be easy enough.
<br>But he wanted a hat that would make him look tough,
<br>And show youkai he wouldn't be taking no guff.
<br>So he searched far and wide, looking down and around,
<br>And he found such a hat laying flat on the ground.
<br>"It's quite fancy - not too much - and fits me just right!"
<br>He went back to the store with a face in delight.
<br>
<br>But when night rolled around and the time came for bed,
<br>And he reached up to take the hat off of his head,
<br>It seemed on rather tight, and it took quite a tug,
<br>But once off, Rinnosuke just gave it a shrug.
<br>And he lay down to bed, but on top of his hair,
<br>That hat he had held in his hands was still there!
<br>
<br>"Oh, I get it," he laughed. "A hat in a hat!
<br>I've got Russian dolls working exactly like that.
<br>So I picked up TWO hats... Now, that works out quite well.
<br>I suppose I can put out the other to sell."
<br>So he pulled the hat off, then exclaimed, "Oh my word!
<br>Don't tell me... the second one covered a third?!"
<br>
<br>He kept pulling off hats deeper into the night,
<br>And after enough, he sighed, "This can't be right!
<br>The dolls have a limit, toward which each layer shrinks,
<br>But these hats are exactly the same... well, I think!"
<br>He was glad they would make him a fair bit of money,
<br>But he wanted it stopped; this was no longer funny.
<br>
<br>So he went to Marisa's, quite a late-at-night visit,
<br>And he asked in despair, "Do you see this? What is it?!
<br>See this one... and this one... and this one... and that!
<br>(FYI, that's the two hundred thirty-third hat!)"
<br>But she had no explanation, and solutions, still nary,
<br>Though she tagged along for all the hats she could carry.
<br>
<br>The two of them spent their night flying around,
<br>But no girl seemed to know, and no answers were found,
<br>As poor Kourin kept spilling more hats on the ground.
<br>If Alice, Patchouli, the works could not tell,
<br>Then just what was this magic? What kind of a spell?
<br>It had to be broken - his hair'd start to smell.
<br>
<br>They went back to the shop, and with no other clue,
<br>Just decided to do the one thing they could do.
<br>They began taking hats off his head as a team;
<br>For the most part, with very-carefully-aimed beams.
<br>But at four-ninety-six, something seemed to be wrong:
<br>"That one's different! As a matter of fact, that one's Hong's!"
<br>
<br>They pulled that one off, and it happened again;
<br>Patchouli's was there, and after that, Chen.
<br>And four-ninety-nine was a black witch's hat -
<br>"Hey, you thief! What're you trying to pull?! Gimme that!"
<br>She pulled on it hard, and out came quite a sight;
<br>Yukari with hands on her hat, clutching tight.
<br>
<br>Her cheeks rivaled Scarlet for being so red,
<br>And Kourin took a parasol-whack to the head.
<br>She stormed out of the store without saying a word,
<br>And the incident was, from that point, never heard.
<br>So no one quite knew just what happened that day...
<br>And it seemed it would likely be staying that way.

<br>It is time at last, Reimu! And this time is now yours.
<br>You're a bona-fide Hakurei maiden, for sure.
<br>Now that you are you, Reimu, you can do as you like.
<br>It's the day you've been wanting since you were a tyke.
<br>You have power within, and it's all where it counts;
<br>You'll be making good friends in excessive amounts.
<br>
<br>You will fly through the skies - maybe not yourself, yet -
<br>But however you fly, you'll fly smartly, we bet.
<br>You'll see humans and youkai, but mostly the latter,
<br>And will fly up to them to ensue in some chatter.
<br>While you may find that some are inclined to a fight...
<br>Well, it's all up to you to decide what is right.
<br>
<br>Oh, the youkai you'll know! You'll be knowing them well!
<br>In the clouds, in the forests, and even in hell.
<br>But they're not all so nice, there are naughty ones too,
<br>And we're counting on you to know which ones are who.
<br>That's your job as a girl of the Hakurei clan,
<br>So we hope that you do the best job that you can.
<br>
<br>There'll be incidents out there, whatever you do,
<br>And it's true that their cleanup is mostly on you.
<br>But just like we've been saying, you'll have all of your friends,
<br>And might even have new ones come time that it ends.
<br>So although it's a nuisance, it's the best of all kinds:
<br>The kind that puts hate in the past and behind.
<br>
<br>And who better to do this than capable you?
<br>You'll meet some on your level, but awfully few.
<br>Yes, you'll stand at the top, in the toppest percents,
<br>As the one one can count on in all incidents.
<br>Your maidenly duties will earn you much fame.
<br>You'll have all of Gensokyo adoring your name!
<br>
<br>Except when you won't. Which will be quite a shame.
<br>
<br>We're sorry to say, but you will find some foes.
<br>At one time or another, they'll comes and they'll goes.
<br>You might have to fight them, but at least let them speak,
<br>And you could get along by the same time next week.
<br>Of course, yes, they could bother you time and again;
<br>Just decide what you like when the time comes to then.
<br>
<br>There may also be times when you're not up to snuff,
<br>The danmaku so fierce that your bombs aren't enough.
<br>And you might ask yourself, now which way do I stream?
<br>What on earth can I graze here? You may want to scream.
<br>But scream you will not, because your heart is strong.
<br>You should trust, just like us, it will not steer you wrong.
<br>
<br>Yet if you get so lost that you can't see the moon,
<br>You could stray to a most awful path very soon.
<br>If you shirked from your duty and sat at the shrine?
<br>Well, now that would just waste all of everyone's time.
<br>Why give up when you have so much else you can give?
<br>We know you are your own, but that's not how to live.
<br>
<br>So then, will you prevail? Yes indeed, without fail!
<br>(And if not, then we're sure you'll still leave a great tale.)
<br>
<br>Well, enough about that now! Your whole life awaits!
<br>It's about time you went and caught up to the greats.
<br>You will travel the land, jumping there, to, and fro,
<br>Just as some do the same - oh, the youkai you'll know!
<br>Are you ready now, Reimu? You must get on your way!
<br>The sun's just coming up! So... go have a great day!
