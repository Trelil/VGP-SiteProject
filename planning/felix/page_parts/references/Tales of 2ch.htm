<font id="size5"><b>Tales of 2ch</b></font>
<br>
<br>Japanese messageboard 2ch has many tales to tell, whether they be 
events unfolding in a thread or explicit stories. I translate all kinds.
<br>
<br><font class="red">Red</font> stories are threads that tell true 
stories (or at least they present themselves that way), usually with 
some conversation between the OP and other 2ch posters.
<br><font class="blue">Blue</font> stories are short stories written out
 and posted in a thread part by part. Many of these are comprised almost
 solely of dialogue between characters without proper names.
<br><font class="green">Green</font> stories are by Fafoo, one of the 
few 2ch authors to identify himself. He has a fairly unique style, not 
really using the "dialogue" format at all.

<br>Bullies and pop groups and rivalries abound. The story moves fast, so you must be fast too.

<br>The first part of the semi-legendary Denko saga. Denko isn't responding to the OP's 600 <s>texts</s> emails, and he's worried! Maybe it's time to confess his undying love... Or send hamsters!
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/21586874902/help-i-cant-contact-my-girlfriend" class="red">[Help!] The Girl I’m Dating Isn't My Girlfriend Anymore (´･ω･`)</a>
<br>Part two of the Denko saga. Did Denko reject OP? Not likely! Better go to her house and - oh, hi, Denko's mom!
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/21629161362/help-the-girl-im-dating-isnt-my-girlfriend-anymore" class="red">[Help!] I Can't Contact My Girlfriend (´･ω･`)</a>
<br>Part three of the Denko saga. Denko changed her number, but OP's got this. He'll go see the cherry blossoms with her!
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/21656509086/help-my-girlfriend-is-testing-me" class="red">[Help!] My Girlfriend Is Testing Me (´･ω･`)</a>
<br>Part four of the Denko saga. The benefactor A-ko helps OP find Denko at the park! This couldn't possibly go bad, right?
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/21674384403/help-im-not-sure-who-i-like-anymore" class="red">[Help!] I'm Not Sure Who I Like Anymore (´･ω･`)</a>
<br>The final part of the Denko saga. OP makes a stunning realization 
about A-ko. And he's never been more sure of anything in his life...

<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/22396529808/im-always-watching" class="red">I'm Always Watching</a>
<br>A short incident involving an artist and a... VERY devoted fan.

<br>What's it like being unable to trust your own mind? (Confused? <a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/23374316103/understanding-replacement-girlfriends-for-dummies">Here's a summary.</a>)
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/23378912424/doctor-its-lovesickness-man-huh" class="blue">Doctor: "It's lovesickness." Man: "Huh?"</a>
<br>A silly story of a doctor and her patient.

<br>The beginning of a story about one lucky virgin and four princesses.
 These new girls seem to like Takumi, but how do they really feel?
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/24758570360/there-was-once-an-ordinary-virgin-part-two" class="red">There Was Once An Ordinary Virgin: Part Two</a>
<br>Hell hath no indifference like a Takumi spurned, but the girls are still plenty friendly with him.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/24791261633/there-was-once-an-ordinary-virgin-part-three" class="red">There Was Once An Ordinary Virgin: Part Three</a>
<br>Takumi is finally ready to meet up with Erika again! Then gets sick. Dammit, Takumi!
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/24824370418/there-was-once-an-ordinary-virgin-part-four" class="red">There Was Once An Ordinary Virgin: Part Four</a>
<br>On the longest night of Takumi's life, all secrets are revealed. Oh, and things get a little crazy later on.

<br>If you're summoning a demoness, you're probably gonna get into some serious spiritual business. Can you say "youkai"?
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/26663782054/man-im-beat-click-door-welcome-back-man" class="blue">Man: "I’m beat..." *click* Door: "Welcome back!" Man: ""</a>
<br>It's always good to have someone - or something - you can rely on.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/26802618210/girl-who-are-you-alien-er-im-an-alien" class="blue">Girl: "Who are you?" Alien: "Er, I’m an alien."</a>
<br>A highly-advanced alien needs emotional energy for a power source, 
and just so happens to find the perfect girl. A very philosophical one, 
actually. (Warning: Contains various kinds of abuse.)
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/27568107702/mom-going-out-hero-just-gonna-save-the-world" class="blue">Mom: "Going out?" Hero: "Just gonna save the world."</a>
<br>Saving the world isn't quite how people used to think of it. But in a way, it gets harder as it gets easier.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/27601900337/man-i-like-you-woman-really" class="blue">Man: "I like you!!" Woman: "Really!"</a>

<br>If you know something's coming, you might as well prepare. Saving the world is too important for just one hero.

<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/29065681212/woman-i-love-you-more-than-anyone" class="blue">Woman: "I love you more than anyone!"</a>

<br>This is no story. This is the scientific method at work.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/30468387978/dark-lord-thanks-for-the-follow" class="blue">Dark Lord: "Thanks for the follow!"</a>
<br>What happens when a generic RPG hero and villain find each other on Twitter? They, uh, get along pretty well, actually.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/30813169377/the-simple-job-of-driving-people-to-suicide" class="green">The Simple Job of Driving People to Suicide</a>
<br>Also known as Azure and Claude. The job is to take control of the 
target's body and lead them to suicide. But it's not so simple this 
time.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/31872169642/on-the-influence-of-a-sister" class="green">On the Influence of a Sister</a>

<br>People in the smoking room are whisked away to a town of smoke and ash. And you never know who you may find there.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/32558991815/the-story-of-hee-and-haw" class="green">The Story of Hee and Haw</a>
<br>Perhaps as a punishment, Hee is supernaturally discouraged from 
falling asleep. But things aren't quite as hopeless as they seem. (Fafoo
 wrote an <a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/68342600736/the-story-of-hee-and-haw-winter-2013-edition">updated version</a> in late 2013.)
<br>

<br>She was perfectly fine with being permanently tied to a boulder which could never be moved. The key word is "was."

<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/36363838019/starting-over" class="green">Starting Over</a>
<br>A man is sent back in time ten years to relive his life. But before 
long, things get problematic. (Later novelized, and translated starting <a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/63608443515/sugaru-miakis-starting-over-part-1">here</a>.)

<br>Just as the title says. It's Cinderella... with 2ch's input, whether we needed it or not.

<br>The forgotten, not-very-long prequel to the Denko saga. Well, better late than never.

<br>When you find out your life is worth far less than you thought, what
 do you do? Sell it. (Later novelized, and translated starting <a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/71910368589/sugaru-miakis-three-days-of-happiness-part-1">here</a>.)

<br><a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/65376867282/manager-welcome-we-sell-anything-and-everything" class="blue">Manager: "Welcome! We sell anything and everything!"</a>
<br>What kind of stuff would people even buy from a shop that sells anything?
