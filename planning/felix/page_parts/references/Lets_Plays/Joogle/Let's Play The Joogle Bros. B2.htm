Okay no update tonight because I'd rather sleep than finish this update,
 but to make up for it here is some JOOGLE CONCEPT ART that was going to
 be unlockable before we gave up on having unlockables.
<br>
<br>Don't ask me what the second picture's name is supposed to mean! I 
had nothing to do with this other than drawing it while I was messing 
around with the "Smudge" option in some DS homebrew art program!

<br>I most likely named the second picture sprite, but I don't have any 
idea what it means so it's almost definitely either me or Chu mocking 
Mitch's terrible naming scheme.
<br>
<br>I also just noticed that Mitch, much like sprULAs8888keM itself, is 
too cool to sign his name. Except in sprULAs8888keM's case, that's 
because sprites don't have hands.
