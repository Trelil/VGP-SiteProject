Hey, did you feel something?
<br>
<br>No? Good. Don't let the Joogle get to you.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0100.gif">
<br>So, right. Icy Core. Pretty bad level. Originally-intended size: 
3000x3000. Actual size: 1200x1536. Obviously, can lag quite terribly.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/IcyCore_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/m.png"> Super Mario RPG - Sunken Ship</a>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0101.gif">
<br>Here's the first place we have to try out our new Water Key which we JUST GOT, not months ago.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0102.gif">
<br>OH GOD I'M OUT OF CONTROL BIRDS BIIIRDS
<br>
<br>But you see that, underneath the GM explosion effect? The Water Key 
has an energy bar. When it runs out (quickly), your weird swimming 
controls stop working and you float to the top like you would if you 
weren't using the key.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0103.gif">
<br>Like so. Geez, I just wanted some totally useless money.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0104.gif">
<br>You'd have to be joogle to expect me to do that! (It leads to the 
same place as the right path, except you get those coins and a faceful 
of turrets at the end. Also check out that WHALAGON up there.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0105.gif">
<br>Adding stealth onto the pile of genres that makes up Joogle, hide in
 these alcoves to evade the hyper-intelligent spike walls that move back
 and foward.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0106.gif">
<br>I distinctly remember that this used to be a TRICK because it looked
 like there were both Joogle and Pilid doors in your way and where I'm 
standing there used to be fake blocks. That was changed and now it just 
looks stupid. Man what was wrong with &lt;<b></b>person who designed level&gt;.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0107.gif">
<br>There's a <s>fake wall I can't walk through</s> invisible wall to the right. Not entirely sure why.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0108.gif">
<br>THE CROWS BEGIN
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0109.gif">
<br>Eggs, hospitals within cracked blocks, and mayors, oh my! If you 
stomp that cracked block, it looks like you'll plummet into spikes since
 you can't stop a stomp, but there's actually an invisible block 
underneath. TRICKY TRICKY
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0110.gif">
<br>I think this is one of the few places in the game where we addressed
 the Joogle/Pilid problem in conversations. Okay, well, we should have 
actually had changed lines depending on who you were, but anyway. Turns 
out this is the exit which leads back to that place where we sunk down 
and fought SS Belvice.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0111.gif">
<br>See? Also, nice not-wave underneath the block I'm on.
<br>
<br>I could have sworn there was a deadly pit under the water, but it turns out we actually considered that.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0112.gif">
<br>I could watch it for hours. But we have other joogles.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0113.gif">
<br>YES I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG FOR THIS. Or I would have been if this were any game where items were worth buying.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0114.gif">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0115.gif">
<br>So I guess this was our excuse for letting you go back to areas to 
get Star Eggs. Okay, whatever. I'm sure we only thought of this because 
there's a few that need the Water/Earth Key, not because we thought 
people would miss some.
<br>
<br>Oops, was mentioning the Earth Key a spoiler?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0116.gif">
<br>Oh, I guess not. Back to the labs!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0117.gif">
<br>Oh right, the sewers. I actually honestly thought I could go do the 
Earth Key now, but then remembered that oh no, Joogle won't let you off 
that easy.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/JooSew_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/m.png"> Mega Man 7 - Shade Man (Alternate) (AKA Ghosts and Goblins)</a>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0118.gif">
<br>Almost 100% certain that gap in the spikes up there didn't exist until we added Hard Mode. Might have been some fake walls, too.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0119.gif">
<br>Here's the place where you actually need the Water Key. Certainly 
the most useful key of all. Where I am is about as low as you can get by
 just stomping. WELL MAYBE IF I STOMP HARDER
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0120.gif">
<br>Looks like we couldn't resist fake walls everywhere. At least it's obvious there is one, though.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0121.gif">
<br>That bubble refills your Water Key, but I'm not sure why it exists. 
All you need the Water Key for is getting under those blocks on the far 
left - you can even go back without having to use it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0122.gif">
<br>BOSS FIGHT: THE PIT
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0123.gif">
<br>Oh, no, it's just this thing. It was originally resized using GM 
with so-called "excellent" quality. "Obviously that makes it look MOST 
EXCELLENT!!" Also, it doesn't even have an explosion, it just instantly 
turns into coins.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0124.gif">
<br>The teleporter back is right under him. How did we in any way "save him"?
<br>
<br>Also, underneath the teleporter is a Star Egg. The message for 
getting a Star Egg only appears after you land. So I grabbed it, rode 
the updraft back up, and checked the teleporter in midair...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0125.gif">
<br>No I didn't.
<br>
<br>Anyway, we go to Joogle Town (or City? I think the game calls it both) and talk to the friend of the guy we saved.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0126.gif">
<br>A key? Oh man, what kind of key?! Dunananana dunanana dunanana dunanana DUNANANA DUNANANA <b>DUNANANADUNANANA -</b>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0127.gif">
<br><b>SKE-LE-TON KEEEEEY</b>
<br>
<br>...Wait, have I even shown off the inventory before now? Well, it's 
useless. Actually, even though you'd still never buy enough items for it
 to be useful, we probably gave you the inventory upgrade when we did 
because of all these idols and keys you have to get.
<br>
<br>So, way back in Inhertz -
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0128.gif">
<br>Oh man, you're serious. He has absolutely no check to disappear after clearing the lava to Fire Chamber. We are terrible.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0129.gif">
<br>So anyway, there's this area here.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0130.gif">
<br>Tada! No, I wasn't talking about finding this area, I was talking about that Blagon standing on spikes.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/InhtzRuin_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/m.png"> Mega Man 8 - Dr. Light</a>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0131.gif">
<br>REVENGE. Now he shoots fire! And can double jump, but that might be a glitch.
<br>
<br>Also, there was a Star Egg in the upper-right corner of his arena. 
If you stand there with the box open, he still jumps and shoots fire but
 the fire instantly stops moving because of the text box.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0132.gif">
<br>After pressing this switch, this guy who was trapped down here jumps
 down and jumps up to the exit, leaving behind this Air Idol.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0133.gif">
<br>Instead of leaving with him, we go further down and end up in Inhertz Supposedly-Secret. OH THE HUMOR
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0134.gif">
<br>After taking the teleporter back to the start of Inhertz and slowly 
walking back to the ruins (at least that passage the guy took works as a
 shortcut), we fall really far because we're stupid, and our stupidity 
is, of course, rewarded!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0135.gif">
<br>And then you climb back up within fake blocks. Of course.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0136.gif">
<br>After walking across the first part of Inhertz one again, remember this guy? Me neither, but he has an idol for us.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0137.gif">
<br>I'm serious, I think this bubble effect might be the best effect in 
the game. Sigh. By the way, guess why this bubble needed to be put here!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0138.gif">
<br>He's seeing crates! He's got the Joogle!
<br>
<br>So we to not steal the gold and get our idol. Air, Fire, and Water 
Idols and a Skullaton Key! What could these possibly be for???
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0139.gif">
<br>NO WAY
<br>
<br>And he was right. It WORKED.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0140.gif">
<br>Rest assured, it has been.
<br>

<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0141.gif">
<br>Yeah, so Surn teleported here from Inhertz to tell us that this door
 needs the three Idols to open. So why isn't there an Earth Idol? I 
dunno, lazy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%207_files/riviera0142.gif">
<br>Colorful. See you next time in BOVOOS CITY...
