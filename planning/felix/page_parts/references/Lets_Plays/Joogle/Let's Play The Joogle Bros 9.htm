<br>Belvice's Castle, everybody!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0213.gif">
<br>Oh my god, a crate! Those are in this game?! (Spoilers: They weren't until now, and then JoogAir was added retroactively!)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0214.gif">
<br>Naturally, RoboJoogles. They jump when you jump. And I finally got a
 screenshot of those lasers! They're actually much more rainbowy in 
motion.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0215.gif">
<br>Okay, what the hell. I swear if we did any testing in Joogle, it was
 to make sure that Hard Mode was possible. Neither of those spikes on 
the left are fake.
<br>
<br>Also, you can still push crates while a textbox is up.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0216.gif">
<br>Now I see Belvice's evil plot! He's using liquefied Joogle (which 
may or may not be regular Joogle) to make explosives to BLOW UP PLANET 
JOOGLE.
<br>
<br>If you couldn't guess, it works exactly like Jumper 2 TNT. Of course.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0217.gif">
<br>I like how this one crow is killing me while the other two are just hovering there because I'm not close enough yet.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0218.gif">
<br>Earth Key and fake blocks, fish yeah. Can't get me here!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0219.gif">
<br>...Unless you can. (Even better, fire is negated by fake blocks, so you can't shoot them!)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0220.gif">
<br>Joogle.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0221.gif">
<br>ROCKET-PROPELLED BALL OF ANGER THAT GOES IN CIRCLES
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0222.gif">
<br>Pretty sure this requires damage, too. Or maybe I'm just not joogle enough to search for the fake blocks.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0223.gif">
<br>It's dark and wet. For some reason. Gee I wonder if those blocks in the water are fake.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0224.gif">
<br>Back to Romper Chomper, but now with the background visible in all its sloppy glory because the floor is invisible.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0225.gif">
<br>All that's worth noting here is these three jerks who have terrible 
lines and a Star Egg. Also, you skip that dark area, but there's nothing
 interesting there anyway.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0226.gif">
<br>THE LIBRARY OF THE AGES. That sure is a work of art there!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0227.gif">
<br>And this sure is a great book.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0228.gif">
<br>Belvice has a long family history.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0229.gif">
<br>So do the dinosaurs.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0230.gif">
<br>And the Joogles.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0231.gif">
<br>I've finally found it! The Mound of Gold! No, wait, it's just randomly-placed blocks for some reason.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0232.gif">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0233.gif">
<br>!!!
<br>
<br>...
<br>
<br><b><i>!!!</i></b>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0234.gif">
<br>ahahahahaha
<br>
<br>Anyway, so it's like "Belvice stole the Heart Key to RULE THE WORLD 
but then it was split and he was BANISHED but then he returned oh no"
<br>
<br>And now it's time to BANISH HIM AGAIN I guess maybe.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0235.gif">
<br>Belvice, take off that silly hat.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0236.gif">
<br>Well, okay, he MIGHT let him.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0237.gif">
<br>Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure Mitch had us put this in because there was no hint to collect the Star Eggs -
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0238.gif">
<br>But I just said that!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0239.gif">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FinalBoss_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/m.png"> Some random guy - Adventure [Sixth]</a>
<br>
<br>You wanna see Belvice? I'll show you Belvice.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0240.gif">
<br>He spends most of the fight up here, floating these spirally blocks near him just because he can.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0241.gif">
<br>Attack 1: Robo-Belvice comes down, shoots fire five times, and explodes.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0242.gif">
<br>Attack 2: Giant fireball comes down. May or may not be aimed at you.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0243.gif">
<br>Attack 3: Fire comes down from the top and splits into more fire.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0244.gif">
<br>Attack 4: CROWS
<br>
<br>Every time he uses an attack, his purple MP bar goes down. When he 
runs out, he comes down to heal and you get close to him and mash X with
 the Fire Key, which isn't as effective as it should be because of its 
energy bar.
<br>
<br>As such, it takes about three rounds of six or so attacks to get through each 25% health phase. Oh boy!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0245.gif">
<br>Attack 5: Giant fire pillars flash in, then turn real.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0246.gif">
<br>Attack 6: Bizarre not-really-sine-wave fireballs. I'm not sure it'll ever hit you if you don't jump. What.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0247.gif">
<br>Attack 7: Two explosions of fireballs from the top-middle of the screen.
<br>
<br>Attack 8: I think there being a fire pillar in the middle instead of
 two on the sides counted as a different attack. Man we're lazy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0248.gif">
<br>Attack 9: Four sets of aimed big fireballs come from the sides.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0249.gif">
<br>Attack 10: Not-sine-wave-fireball with INTENSE ALPHA TRAIL. I think it can maybe hurt you now.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0250.gif">
<br>Attack 11: Belvice statue falls and makes the ground turn to fire for a while. Somehow.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0251.gif">
<br>Attack 12: Single aimed fireball that reaims at you when it hits a border. Does this a couple times.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0252.gif">
<br>Oh no! Does this mean Belvice CANNOT BE STOPPED?!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0253.gif">
<br>HYAAAAAAAAAA
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FinalBossS4_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/m.png"> Some random guy - Adventure [Sixth] (Intensed by Mitchell_XD)</a>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0254.gif">
<br>TRUE FORM OF: SILLY-LOOKING OBVIOUS-WEAKPOINT SPIDER (except it's not really a weakpoint but still)
<br>
<br>There isn't really any change except the sprite and the music. Maybe
 the spiral blocks are more intense, I can't really tell. He does attack
 quicker (which is actually a good thing), but he was already speeding 
up in phases 2 and 3.
<br>
<br>Also, his transformation actually refills your health. Er, okay, not complaining.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0255.gif">
<br>Attack 13: Sideways fireballs. (Some are going left and some are 
going right - from the screen, I know it looks really hard to dodge, but
 it's pretty easy.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0256.gif">
<br>Attack 14: Fireball explosion from the top. Except they bounce off the sides.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0257.gif">
<br>Attack 15: Belvice-Bot falls and explodes like this instead of shooting fireballs. Uh, okay.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0258.gif">
<br>Attack 16: Fireball splits into four fireballs which split into four fireballs.
<br>
<br>And that's all of them. Whew.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0259.gif">
<br>Too lazy to animate this, but he's, like, wriggling his legs and 
turning left and right. It possibly makes him even less threatening.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0260.gif">
<br>See? I told you. Liquefied Joogle explosives.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0261.gif">

<br>
<br>NOT-TIMED-OR-ANYTHING ESCAPE SEQUENCE BUT SHAKE YOUR MONITOR ANYWAY
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0262.gif">
<br>escape sequences lol
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0263.gif">
<br>WE MADE IT OFF PLANET JOOGLE
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br><i>BUT...</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%209_files/riviera0264.gif">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>Oh, and then you have to ctrl-alt-delete it or something.
<br>
<br>I'm sure you're thinking, "but there must be a better ending! The masterpiece that is Joogle cannot end this way!"
<br>
<br>And you're right. There is a different ending. If you get all the Star Eggs.
<br>
<br>But who's stupid enough to do that?
<br>
<br>The answer: <b><i>YOU.</i></b> This is a <b>Let's</b> Play, so get playanig already. If you want the good ending, you need to earn it.
<br>
<br>In the meantime, here's some unused music.
