<br>I read this no less than three times and even if it is some bizarre old in-joke, I don't get it at all.

<br>It's impossible to tell from this, but this is a several-second loop
 of something that very vaguely resembles a really simple Base Attack 
Puzzle level. Product placement!
<br>

<br>So maybe they're just supposed to be nonsensical and dumb? Well, if 
there's one thing we know how to make, it's nonsensical and dumb 
characters!

<br>Get it, it's a skull and crossbones. Anyway we can't go to <s>A B Y S S  O F  D E A T H</s> Bovoos Abyss yet. Joke's on you, I didn't want to go there anyway! Maybe.

<br>This place introduces timed switches. You hit the red one then hurry
 and press the blue one before the red one unswitches then get through 
the door before the blue one unswitches. Pretty sure you die if you get 
stuck in the door.

<br>Continuity error since I died and wasn't quite sure the first time 
around, but you know what's great? For absolutely no logical reason, the
 timed doors close when you switch characters. What you're supposed to 
do here is just switch to Pilid and go through, but instead you have to 
do things twice to both hit the switch and get out as Pilid.
<br>
<br>Also, I'm really not sure where that bug came from, especially since I doubt I touched the time doors after testing this area.
<br>

<br>Good to know. Apparently this was the only guy we were saving and 
Belvice went to the Abyss to summon the Seven AA. BUT HOW DO WE GET 
THERE?

mostly responsible for those parts. I should make Metal Gear Solid or

<br>
<br>Guys, it's dark, I'm scared.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0166.gif">
<br>I'm especially scared of this Scorpino who's flipping back and forward and got stuck in my way.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0167.gif">
<br>Of course, AFTER I talked to this guy, he got free and started 
unleashing his lasery wrath. (Which I swear was visible in this 
screenshot but I guess not.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0168.gif">
<br>I sure wish I was Wario or something so I could smash through these 
blocks. Or Raishuu so I could flip my gravity. Except that game didn't 
actually have sideways gravity.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0169.gif">
<br>It's a GOLD TURRET!! They shoot you even if you're far away and 
faster. As if regular ones weren't annoying enough (well the regular 
ones aren't very harmful but still).
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0170.gif">
<br>Belvice is the least threatening villain ever. It's probably because he's a Joogle.
<br>

<br>OH NO

<br>This sure is exciting and Hell-ish.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0175.gif">
<br>Oh boy, red crows. Because regular ones weren't fast enough, annoying enough, or abused enough.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0176.gif">
<br>Ugh.
<br>
<br>And apparently it's impossible to go back up to start the platform without getting hit!
<br>
<br>And I think that, because there's no Joogle switcher, it's possible 
to get stuck and save with low enough health to only survive one hit. 
And the crows respawn whenever you reload. Pinnacle of game design.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0177.gif">
<br>Guess I better go down!

<br>Aw, what a cute little mole. Oh, he hit something. It made a beeping sound.
<br>

<br>EXPLOSION THAT'S A BIG MOLE AND HE'S SCURRYING OFF WITH OUR EARTH KEY
<br>
<br>Now, I know you've all been looking forward to seeing a video of how hard Attack Mole is (it's certainly moreso than Ballos).
<br>Alas, since making the SS Belvice video, I have become a YouTube 
Superstar™. I am thus afraid such a video would entail losing many 
subscribers who would have never suspected I had helped make such an 
awful game.
<br>
<br>So instead, you will get this animated GIF.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0181.gif">

<br>
<br><b>PREPARE FOR INTENSE BOSS SUMMARY</b>
<br>The rockapillar continuously goes around the room in a circle.
<br>Attack Mole jumps in I think three different ways:
<br><ul><li>Digging along the bottom</li>
<li>From a side upward, falling and digging down around the center</li>
<li>From a side sideways, then bouncing on the side walls and digging down</li></ul>
At about 75% health, fireballs start to shoot from the top-middle in an arc.
<br>At about 50% health, the fireballs shoot their own fireballs at you.
<br>At about 25% health, they shoot their own fireballs in both directions, and I think these fireballs shoot some fireballs too.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0182.gif">
<br>Anyway, I had considerably less trouble when I didn't have to remember to press the screenshot button every once in a while.
<br>
<br>(Also, it's pretty much impossible to catch especially since I 
forgot about it, but after he loses all his life and finishes his 
current attack, Attack Mole dives down into the ground at hyper-speed 
and explodes.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0183.gif">

<br>We fall down a pit and of course Surn is here to annoy us about our journay.
<br>

<br>Also, swimming in lava, which I swear has better controls than swimming in water.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0187.gif">
<br>So we're back here in this tunnel before Attack Mole, but now some debris at the start is gone. Perfectly sensible.
<br>

<br>MECHA-BLAGONS. They fire out these bombs-that-look-nothing-like-bombs directly up and they fall down.

<br>Oh, so tricksy. Of course if you fall for this there's actually a 
health refill next to the Star Egg so you can just dive into the laser 
anyway.

<br>Pate (the cat) jumps around and alternatingly shoots tri-shots of fire and a semi-homing laser shot.
<br>Vargie goes back and forward shooting quad-shots of knives. It's 
somehow not visible in any of the screenshots, but he's usually pretty 
high up and only hittable with some Air Key-ing.
<br>
<br>Also, this boss is actually probably harder than Belvice and you're 
forced to use Pilid, although Joogle's slowness would probably suck 
anyway.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0207.gif">
<br>After you beat Pate, he and his skateboard fall off the screen and 
Vargie comes down for easier hitting, but then fires a heck of a lot 
more knives.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%208_files/riviera0208.gif">
