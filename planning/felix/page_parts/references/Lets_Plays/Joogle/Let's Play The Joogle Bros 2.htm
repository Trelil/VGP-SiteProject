Welcome back to Let's Play The Joogle Bros.
<br>
<br>One thing I forgot completely with the last update is to include the
 midis that play in-game so you can listen to them while you read this 
for the full Joogle experience. But they're here this time.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0001.png">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/chuchino/JoOut_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/m.png"> Megaman ZX - Area A</a>
<br>
<br>Right after the first level I ever designed for Joogle comes one of 
the last levels I ever designed for Joogle. This level was added late in
 development because the first chapter was really short.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0002.png">
<br><i><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/g.gif">: They act like this is some video game.
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/g.gif">: They always call me "NPC_Still_o". What kind of weird name is that?</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0003.png">
<br>The weird floating black thing is a "Gunner", which shoots bullets 
at you that are pretty hard to dodge. However, the bullets do so little 
damage that if you're playing as Joogle, you need to get hit by two of 
them before there is a visible decrease in your health bar, so you can 
pretty much pretend they don't exist for the whole game.
<br>
<br>There's also a blue door with a picture of Joogle on it and a 
crossed out picture of Pilid, and character switching machines below it.
 I couldn't get through this door with Pilid for some reason, so I 
reluctantly switched to Joogle. 
<br>
<br>But before going through the door I decided to commit suicide by 
jumping off to the right. Unfortunately there was a platform below, with
 this lonely green guy. 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0004.png">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0005.png">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0006.png">
<br>Sounds like a challenge!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0007.png">
<br>I'm not stuck in a wall. This is the secret passage. There are a ton
 of gold coins in here but you can't tell unless you listen really 
closely for the coin collection sound.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0008.png">
<br>The lion boss turns out to just be a red Joogle. I could have made this funny, but instead I referenced a 4chan meme. Awesome.  
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0009.png">
<br>I don't really know what I was doing with this teleporter. It just takes you back to the top of the cliff.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0010.png">
<br>And then it quotes Starfox 64 for some reason. Okay. Anyways, time to go in that Joogle door.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0011.png">
<br>Up here we see a crate, which means there's going to be a crate 
puzzle. This puzzle is somewhat of a trouble spot for new Joogle players
 because crates have a habit of glitching up occasionally when they go 
outside the view, which causes the game to freeze and then you have to 
end the process in Task Manager. That's Joogle Quality.
<br>
<br>Down at the bottom this guy tells us to watch out for Gunners:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0012.png">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0013.png">
<br>But we have no time to worry. We've got a puzzle to solve.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0014.png">
<br>To get out of here, you have to push this crate down...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0015.png">
<br>Then push it over here, jump up, and change to Pilid...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0016.png">
<br>Which allows you to exit from this Pilid door and get down here.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0017.png">
<br>It's true!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0018.png">
<br>Unfortunately I forgot that I have to push the crate I left near the
 switch machines back out here. So I go up and ride this platform back 
to that Joogle door.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0019.png">
<br>This looks like an ordinary screenshot, but... 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0020.png">
<br>Now I'll have you know we put a lot of effort into trying to fix 
this freezing bug, as shown by these unedited excerpts from our 
chatlogs:
<br>
<br>(7:40 PM) Chuchino: oh fish it freezes in joogout didn't we fix that bug years ago 
<br>(7:45 PM) Chuchino: man the crates randomly get stuck in walls in joogout 
<br>(7:46 PM) Chuchino: moving platforms vanish too didn't we fix all the deactivating bugs 
<br>(7:49 PM) vgperson: geez. 
<br>(7:49 PM) vgperson: are you telling me we HAVE TO FIX BUGS IN JOOGLE 
<br>---
<br>(8:00 PM) Chuchino: can you beat the level 
<br>(8:00 PM) vgperson: yes 
<br>(8:00 PM) Chuchino: good enough 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0021.png">
<br>Anyways I reload and do the puzzle again and then I can jump high enough to reach the next platform.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0022.png">
<br>After that there's another puzzle where you stack these crates to 
jump to here. This guy recommends that you save your game before jumping
 up those platforms.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0023.png">
<br>Oh, you.
<br>
<br>At the top of these platforms, we find...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0024.png">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/chuchino/JoAir_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/m.png"> Donkey Kong Country - Fear Factory</a>
<br>
<br>The Air Chamber! With more pointless disappearing walls.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0025.png">
<br>KING SURN got here before us and makes a helpful observation. We have to go down and find a switch.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0026.png">
<br>The first half of this level was designed by me, but I was too lazy 
to finish it so Mitch made the second half. First we have a forced 
Joogle section with some Gunners, which is impossible to die in unless 
you're trying to.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0027.png">
<br>Then you switch to Pilid for a section that's slightly more possible
 to die in. It's still extremely easy if you're actually paying 
attention, but if you just run through everything taking hits you'll 
take a lot of damage.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0028.png">
<br>Like this.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0029.png">
<br>To get back to the top we ride a giant updraft with lots of Gunners. 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0030.png">
<br>I'm one hit away from death here, thanks to my policy of not dodging
 anything. Fortunately when you switch characters you get fully healed.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0031.png">
<br>Now we have Mitch's half of the level. There's an underwater health 
pickup, but there's absolutely no reason to return here once you get the
 Water Key. And even if there was, there are no dangers on the path to 
the health pickup once you've hit the switch, so it's entirely useless 
and I cannot fathom why it exists. After that, there are some Blagons 
that are really easy to dodge.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0032.png">
<br>Here we have some floating division and multiplication signs. If you
 jump down you can go to the right to reach the end of the Air Chamber, 
or fall further and go left to find a path to the Star Egg, which you 
need the Air Key to get anyways. So we'll go right.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0033.png">
<br>You may have noticed that I change to Joogle every time I enter a 
new room. This is supposed to happen for some reason. I am pretty sure 
that reason is "we were lazy".
<br>
<br>Up next is a cutscene with KING SURN and BELVICE then a boss fight against GALFIO. Here is a video of that: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHm_rmgrfg0">link</a>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0034.png">
<br>Galfio was originally supposed to be a phoenix, but vgperson 
couldn't draw one. So she drew this thing, which is apparently supposed 
to be a bird??? He was extremely easy when he was first created, so I 
went back and made him harder by making it so the bullets split into two
 when they hit the ground. Except half the time the bullets spawn inside
 the ground and are immediately destroyed by it. I don't know why this 
was never fixed. Also, there is no explanation for why the electricity 
switch does not do anything unless Galfio stops in midair on top of it. 
<br>
<br>After you beat him and get the Air Key there's a stupid tutorial for
 it. It's really boring so there's no point screenshotting most of it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0035.png">
<br>At some point in development we realized that it was never explained
 anywhere how to bring up the pause screen/inventory, so we stuck it in 
here!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0036.png">
<br>These blue arrows refill your Air Key meter when you touch them. 
They're like Golden Arrows in Jumper but for Air Key power instead of 
double jumps.
<br>
<br>We reach the end and...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0037.png">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/chuchino/JoLab_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/m.png"> F-Zero - Big Blue</a>
<br>
<br>Now we're back in Lab 1! Let's see what Hint Joogle has to say about that.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0038.png">
<br>Oh hey, a hint that's actually useful. Thanks, Hint Joogle!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0039.png">
<br>We go up there and find a red test tube baby, which doesn't do 
anything. But if we go further up we reach our destination, the TELEPORT
 ROOM, where we are treated to this thrilling cutscene:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/jogel.gif">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/chuchino/JoTeleport_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/m.png"> Lufia and the Fortress of Doom - Kingdom of Alekia</a>
<br>
<br>Before moving on to Chapter 2, we have to get the Air Key back. Now,
 since he ran out the way we entered, the logical solution is to go back
 to Lab 1, right? There's even a convenient teleport to Lab 1 right near
 the entrance! Wrong. If you weren't so stupid you would have realized 
that the Air Key is in some random other area, and if you go back to Lab
 1 and save there you're stuck permanently since you can't fly back up 
to the Teleport Room. Joogle Quality.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0040.png">
<br>So we go past the Lab 1 teleport and enter the next teleport, to Joogle City.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0041.png">
<br>But Joogle City is useless too, aside from a few Star Eggs and I 
think you need to do something here before the fourth chapter or 
something. If you had an ounce of intelligence in your tiny pea-brain 
you would have realized you're supposed to go to the next teleporter and
 the Air Key is on some pedestal halfway through the area it leads to. 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0042.png">
<br>I honestly have no idea how anyone was supposed to figure this out. 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%202_files/j0043.png">
<br>See you next update!
