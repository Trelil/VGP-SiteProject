So anyway, I beat Mother Crow again. I really don't know how anyone missed that glitch.
<br>
<br>After taking the teleporter to the base, we find her unconscious on 
top of that up arrow sign. After saving and reloading, she's doing okay 
again.

<br><i>Belvice, you say? Caw... that name rings a bell. I wonder if he has anything to do with my stolen eggs?</i>
<br>
<br>And nothing else really happens. Well, back to Belvice.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0069.gif">
<br>Oh yeah, and you should play Base Attack Puzzle.
<br>
<br>So, what extremely normal mission does Belvice want us to do now?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0070.gif">
<br>What?
<br>
<br><b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgGw9a3kcDk">Video: This is what.</a></b>

<br>
<br>After, uh... that, Belvice just tells us to go away. Well, now what? Let's talk to Mother Crow for some reason!
<br>
<br>She's still looking for her stolen eggs (but not really, she hasn't 
moved at all), so she flies us NORTH OF FRAGATICE to find them.
<br>
<br>Wait, how does she know they're here? Joogle, that's why.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0071.gif">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FragNorth_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/m.png"> Megaman Zero 3 - Snowfield</a>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0072.gif">
<br>Orange jump blocks disappear after being used. Not at all exactly like Jumper. Actually, that's right, this isn't nearly as fun.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0073.gif">
<br>These ball-and-chains vgperson just made are <i>really</i> cool, and we all know using really cool stuff constantly is what makes a really cool level.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0074.gif">
<br>And on the opposite end of the spectrum, use this thing that's 
otherwise only used once in a secret room that's impossible to find.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0075.gif">
<br>The second area isn't very interesting either. Its pause screen name
 is "Norther of Fragatice." I guess it has more random bouncing buckets.
 I mean, those are wacky, right?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0076.gif">
<br>Hey, eggs. They just kind of fade out when you touch them. Mission complete!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0077.gif">
<br>Oh, Mother Crow. However, it turns out this isn't all of her eggs. I
 knew I couldn't trust that random pile of eggs next to spikes.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0078.gif">
<br>Yeah. Anyway, Mother Crow decides enough is enough, she's had it with Belvice's base in Fragatice.
<br>
<br>Wait, why does Belvice has a base in Fragatice?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0079.gif">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FragBase_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/m.png"> Final Fantasy 5 - The Four Warriors of Dawn</a>
<br>
<br>Three characteristics of Belvice's base: lasers. (See above.) 
Falling blue blocks. (See above, or any Jumper game.) Instant death red 
spikes. (Seen in many disguises in I Wanna Be the Guy.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0080.gif">
<br>Also, more weird looking Air Chamber fans, random bouncing buckets, and homing crows. Yeah, Mitch made this level.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0081.gif">
<br>And this. And we're only in the first area of three!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0082.gif">
<br>What the heck is this thing? Let's shoot it with fire.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0083.gif">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0084.gif">
<br>Massive base battles that are only possible with the power of the Playjoogle 3.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0085.gif">
<br>Two things before we go to the second area: one, pit of coins. Two, a fricking <i>frozen Jumper Community Project reference.</i> At least, I think that's what that is.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0086.gif">
<br>Belvice isn't very good at facing his missiles the right way. How 
exactly are they just floating here, anyway? Well, it blows up another 
building. I THINK you need to blow up all the buildings to proceed to 
the next area. There's no way I'm bothering to check.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0087.gif">
<br>Truly, this is the 3-4 of Joogle.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0088.gif">
<br>This switch opens up a path earlier to a Star Egg. But that's not 
important. What's important is that if you stand there while the "you 
pressed a switch" message is up, the ball-and-chain can reach you and 
hurt you. After all the time I spent making the enemies unnaturally stop
 while text boxes are up, I forgot about these things.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0089.gif">
<br>This is the only room in the entire game that wants you to be Pilid the whole time. Is that good?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0090.gif">
<br>No, not really. This room is entirely flat and boring except Mitch 
threw a billion enemies down here that you have to run through without 
dying. I guess it's less boring than killing them all with Joogle.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0091.gif">
<br>Okay, so I was right. It's kind of trivial in this area, though, 
since those two missiles in the screenshot are the only ones in the 
area. But who wouldn't want to see that sweet missile animation two more
 times?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0092.gif">
<br>Great, now we're INSIDE the base. According to the music names, it's
 supposed to be "Fragatice Jail," but it's not for some reason.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FragJail_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/m.png"> Metroid Fusion - Sector 5 Revisited</a>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0093.gif">
<br>Acid! Why does Belvice have acid in his base? Man, I don't know.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0094.gif">
<br>I lied about the 3-4 thing. This section is entirely too long.
<br>
<br>These red spikes <i>used</i> to just do a ton of damage and send you
 back to the last solid platform you were on, but the blue blocks 
screwed that up, so now they're just instant death.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0095.gif">
<br>What's with this random cracked block? Let's pound it with Pilid. HEY FAKE BLOCKS HEY A STAR EGG.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0096.gif">
<br>Except now I'm trapped. At least there's a save right before this.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0097.gif">
<br>There's a lot of character switching in this room, but it's just to 
force you into taking a longer path. Also, that Gunner is shooting me 
through the door, what the hell.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0098.gif">
<br>These crows are perfectly still. It's really, really creepy. When we pound the blocks, they just fly off in random directions.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%206_files/riviera0099.gif">
<br>And finally, this hallway takes us back to Fragatice Village 
somehow. The gate at the end is open for some reason. I think we know 
what that means.

<br>Next time: maybe the worst level in the game? Probably not, but it's pretty bad.
