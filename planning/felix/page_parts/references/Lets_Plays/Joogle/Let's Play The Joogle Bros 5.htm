Well, I lied about the delay. I got really bored and decided I could 
either make a Joogle update or a Riviera update. So I rolled my 
100-sided die five times and got five zeroes, which means Joogle update.
<br>
<br>First of all, something I forgot last time: the original Fire Snake 
music, found on purezc.com. We were using this for AGES before someone, 
probably Chu, changed it to Dogadon. Keep that in mind as you listen to 
it.

<br>
<br>From the purezc page I had to search for to find the composer: 
"Credits: Mario Paint. I replicated this song from when I created it 
back in Mario Paint."
<br>
<br>Second and third, two things Chu forgot to put back in the first update.

<br>
<br>Now, on to Chapter 3!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0039.gif">
<br>In a move that surprises no one, this banner has nothing to do with anything. This is an ice level, not a water level.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0040.gif">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FragVillage_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/m.png"> Chrono Trigger - Corridors of Time</a>
<br>
<br>Fragatice Village has some intensely-sprited huts where penguins 
live. Also, it's icy, you can tell that's ice because it's white and 
transparent.
<br>
<br>Since Chu made this area, it has a bunch of NPCs. Since this is Joogle, they make dumb jokes.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0041.gif">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0042.gif">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0043.gif">
<br>Hey, wait! Barely-visible cracked blocks?! We've gotta slam those.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0044.gif">
<br>What.
<br>
<br>This is Fragatice Secret, which has <a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FragSecret_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/m.png"> Flash Man's music.</a>
 It also has a terrible-looking scrolling background, crows that fly 
around in circles, and black death eggs that fall from the sky.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0045.gif">
<br>A LOT of BOUNCING black death eggs. You have to survive a while and 
then the very out-of-place Air Chamber blocks randomly fade out so you 
can get the Star Egg and get out. Pretty dumb, huh?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0046.gif">
<br>Well, it used to be worse. <a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FragSecretWhat_bgm.mid">With this music, even.</a> And the name when you paused was "fR4gt1$e \/i11AGE."
<br>
<br>Fragatice Village was all Chu, Fragatice Secret was all me, and THIS
 was all Mitch. And Mitch was the project leader. It sums up Joogle 
pretty well, really.
<br>
<br>Back to the final version, we reach the right end of the village and talk to the mayor.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0047.gif">
<br><i>Water Key? Why, sure, you can have it! It's right here behind 
this old gate. Let me get my gate key. I hope I didn't lose it to those 
scaly creatures.
<br>It's locked up in Spealburg, the world's largest iceberg. You better have a Firaga spell or something.
<br>Ah, here's the gate key! With this, I shall open the gate, and the overdone* "item of power" dealie will be yours!
<br>Yes, here we go! I will open it!
<br>3...
<br>2...
<br>1...
<br>AND IT'S OPEN! Wow, I'm glad that wasn't interrupted by something dangerous!
<br>Wait a minute... did you hear that? There's something coming from the other side of the gate!
<br>Who could it possibly be? I'm gonna go check it out.</i>
<br>
<br>* Originally "cliché," but Courier didn't have an accented e, apparently.
<br>
<br>That sure was an exciting cutscene I had to transcribe, let's do it again.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0048.gif">
<br><i>Taking over, you old penguin! Fragatice Village is mine!
<br>Not if I can stop it! I can take you down!
<br>Heh... unlikely.
<br><b>THE MAYOR EXPLODES INTO GRAY DUST</b>
<br>Guh?!
<br>He's out of the way for now, but I'll deal with him later.
<br>Hmmph... Joogle. (actually it's pilid thanks)
<br>But I can't let you stop me now! Not when I'm so close to the Water Key!
<br>Off with you!
<br><b>RED EXPLOSION THAT MAKES JOOGLE TURN RED AND MOVE UP AND LEFT</b></i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0049.gif">
<br>Well, that wasn't so bad! We landed in SNOWY FOREST.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FragForest_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/m.png"> Kirby's Dream Land 3 - Sand Canyon 1</a>
<br>
<br>The penguin here helpfully informs us that during the interval in 
which we were flying, the ice cold Belvice brainwashed all the other 
penguins. He was chillin' out here, though, so he's cool.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0050.gif">
<br>Around Chapter 3, Chu started trying to (emphasis on that) make 
Joogle more of a platformer instead of a boring RPG consisting of fetch 
quests. So this is the first level with these jump blocks that are 
absolutely not used in Jumper.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0051.gif">
<br>With all the fake block Star Eggs, I wonder if we expected people to buy Fake Vision or to just jump into walls a lot.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0052.gif">
<br>Here's some more crows that move in circles and moving spikes. Fun JoogleFact: the circling crows use paths. Hi-technical!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0053.gif">
<br>These crows follow you. Chu completely regrets ever adding these, 
and you'll soon see why. Also, there was a second one, but I got too far
 away from it and it flew off into the sky.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0054.gif">
<br>After a bunch more jumping, the level concludes with an INTENSE 
UPDRAFT THROUGH CIRCLING CROWS. Then we're back in Fragatice Village.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0055.gif">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/FragVillageAtk_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/m.png"> Chrono Trigger/VGMusic.com - Zeal (F-Zero Remix)</a>
<br>
<br>For being on fire (particles), these huts are still pretty icy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0056.gif">
<br>Could it be that the mayor ISN'T a <s>peasant</s> penguin? But he looked pretty much like all the other penguins when we saw him.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0057.gif">
<br>What. How did all this happen in such a short time, anyway? If we 
were unconscious for a long time, there should have been SOMETHING 
between getting blasted and waking up in the forest, right? No joogle.
<br>
<br>Since we're stupid, we talk to mayor Belvice anyway and he tells us 
this is all probably Mother Crow's fault. So we should climb Fragatice 
Heights and kill her. We don't have much else to do and we've already 
established a hatred of crows, so let's go.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0058.gif">
<br>I JUST WONDER WHAT DIRECTION MOTHER CROW'S UP TO
<br>
<br>(Also, still Sand Canyon music. Which fits ice levels better than the name would imply.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0059.gif">
<br>I think that one day, Mitch asked me to sprite some frozen things to
 randomly place in Fragatice areas. So I was like... "BRILLIANT."
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0060.gif">
<br>This used to say "Hi, I'm Pixel." Chu actually made this level vertical because Outer Wall was cool. Yep.
<br>
<br>He tells us that we should come back with the Earth Key. Oh boy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0061.gif">
<br>Another JoogleFact: once frozen, signs are <i>unreadable.</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0062.gif">
<br>I'm not sure why there are gray factory blocks below these ice 
blocks. I'm thinking it went along the lines of "Floating ice blocks? 
Ridiculous. Hold them up with some floating factory blocks."
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0063.gif">
<br>Bouncing buckets. Yes, there are really evil buckets in this game. I don't know why they're up here, though.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0064.gif">
<br>Finally, right under Mother Crow's really empty nest, there's a 
broken sign that you're supposed to realize means there's a Star Egg 
over here. Joogle intuition?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0065.gif">
<br>She has Galfio's SMRPG boss music and a lot of health, which makes 
her one bad mother - shut yo' Joogle! I'm just talking about Mother 
Crow! Then we can fire the Fire Key at her a lot whenever she swoops 
down!
<br>
<br>Interestingly (not really), a bunch of feather particles fly out 
whenever you shoot her. None of the other bosses really have a hurt 
effect, so yeah.
<br>
<br>Also, you can shoot the eggs she drops. And they explode into black particles. Joogle is a heartless baby murderer.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0066.gif">
<br>And then she dies in a way that's probably supposed to reference 
Monster X, except Monster X was way, way harder than Mother Crow.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%205_files/riviera0067.gif">
<br>And since I was on the wrong side of the screen when Mother Crow 
died, the blocks over here were deactivated. Which means they weren't 
changed into the blocks that fade out and disappear.
<br>
<br>FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF

climb a cliff with tons of those black birds in a platform level thats 
similer to outer wall in CS. Then at the top you get into a big nest and
 fight mother crow
