So Chu said she'll finish the thread eventually... <i>but what if <b>I</b> do it????</i>
<br>
<br>(Spoilers: I'll probably still take forever, but at least I have a <i>thrilling</i> desire to see this finished, unlike Chu.)
<br>
<br>Last time on The Joogle Bros., THE CANNON FIRED AND THE MYSTERIOUS 
JOOGLE DISAPPEARED. But before we go to the second half of Inhertz:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0014.gif">
<br>It's not a glitch, it's fake walls that lead to a Star Egg! So, into the village part.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0015.gif">
<br>This guy wants us TO NOT LOSING THE GOLD. But we can't yet because 
Mitch makes all his characters like dogs, which means Joogles can't 
swim. They just kinda... can't go below a certain depth. Since about 
half of his galds are underwater, we need the Water Key, I mean what.
<br>
<br>(Actually, the villager directly mentions the Water Key. Subtle!)
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>(Wait, dogs can't swim, right? They better not, I don't think I have any other opportunities to make dog jokes.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0016.gif">
<br>Why would someone be here to say this?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0017.gif">
<br>I'm not sure how you're supposed to figure this out without buying 
Fake Vision or whatever (ahahahaha), but these fake walls lead to 
another egg. The <i>egg</i> is fully visible, at least.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0018.gif">
<br>What a dam. I don't know what all of the machines are doing here 
since there aren't any enemies in this area. I guess saving is kind of 
convenient, but in reality, nothing in Joogle is convenient.
<br>
<br>So over here, we press the switch on top of the dam to drop the 
crate to destroy the other crate to push the BLUE switch to drain the 
lava in the other half of Inhertz. Why does any of this stuff exist?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0019.gif">
<br>Also, some sweet aquatic life that frequently gets stuck in both walls and does <i>absolutely nothing.</i> I'm really proud of programming these, which is why I drew that sweet unlockable art of them.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0020.gif">
<br>But I AM in Inhertz Village! Well, what it actually means is the 
other part that's nothing like a village and should really be called 
Inhertz Valley or something. But why not just walk back instead of using
 this teleporter? Because Mitch doesn't know how to program coming in 
from an alternate entrance so you can't do that.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0021.gif">
<br>For those who have photographic memories of Joogle levels, including
 parts that I don't think are in any of Chu's screenshots, you may 
notice there's no lava here anymore. For everyone sane, there's no lava 
here anymore. So we do what would kill us in any other situation and 
jump off the bottom of the screen.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0022.gif">
<br>We end up in the FIRE CHAMBERS, which have <a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/InhtzFire_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/m.png"> Metal Man's music</a> which is the only cool thing about them. By the way, lava looks a lot like water. But that's silly, you can't swim in lava.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0023.gif">
<br>Here's a Firebird. It probably has some really terrible name that I 
forget. It slowly moves toward you and if it touches anything it 
explodes. GM particle effects, am I right?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0024.gif">
<br>After pressing a switch to open a door like one screen away, we run 
into the Fire Chamber's main defense: SPONTANEOUS FIRES. They 
intermittently exist and stop existing. And not even in an alternating 
way with other fires; I'm totally safe on the platform I'm standing on 
here.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0025.gif">
<br>A free Star Egg and silver coin! The boss of this level sure is generous.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0026.gif">
<br>When Chu actually played this level (like months after it was made),
 she complained about having to wait more than two seconds for moving 
platforms to come near you. So we made BUTTON PLATFORMS that start 
moving after you step on them. Brilliant, huh?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0027.gif">
<br>And after making those platforms, we put in a normal one here 
anyway. We made a SIGN about deliberately going against Chu's advice.
<br>
<br>And wait a minute oh god what is that Star Egg doing there.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0028.gif">
<br>Save point? Uh oh. Time to fight FIRE SNAKE.

<br>
<br>I never actually checked to see if you could get stuck in the blocks when they appear. Probably!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0029.gif">
<br>Killing or damaging is my <i>favorite!</i> The tutorial also 
explains Joogle/Pilid doors even though there have already been a couple
 of them and come on, how else would they work.
<br>
<br>This room (wherever it is) happens to have a WARP TUNNEL to JoogLabs. Time to meet our old friend!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0030.gif">
<br>Thanks, Pepsijoogle.
<br>
<br>Instead of doing that, though, we can now go to JOOGLE CITY. City of terrible-looking, deformed skyscrapers.
<br>
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/JoTown_bgm.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/m.png"> Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga - Beanbean Castle Town</a>
<br>

<br><i>Oh! Sorry, I'm playing Joogle Brothers on my DS.</i>
<br>
<br>Yeah, I don't think Mitch cares about the Joogle universe making sense. But he <i>really</i> cares about Earth physics, guys.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0032.gif">
<br>Oh hey it's BELVICE'S RELOCATED CRASHED ROCKET let's JUMP AND PRESS 
SPACE NEAR THE BACK END OF IT. How are you supposed to find this.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0033.gif">
<br>This is the hardest puzzle ever because I don't think that red shoot
 block exists anywhere else. Also, that statue is totally useless.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0034.gif">
<br>Also let's talk to nothing up here. I somehow forgot to screenshot 
it but a test NPC appears and says some horribly unfunny stuff.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0035.gif">
<br>Also if you keep walking here you find some fake walls and a switch that I guess does something.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0036.gif">
<br>I climbed some clouds leading out of a skyscraper to get a Star Egg.
 No, seriously, Joogle City is really dumb and there are like 10 Star 
Eggs here.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0037.gif">
<br>I don't think I need to say anything here.
<br>
<br>And then I left Joogle City. It's hard to properly explain how 
absurd and pointless it is without making like a 10 minute video, which 
I'm far too lazy to do since no one will watch it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%204_files/riviera0038.gif">
<br>Next time! Same Joogle update delay, same Joogle topic!
