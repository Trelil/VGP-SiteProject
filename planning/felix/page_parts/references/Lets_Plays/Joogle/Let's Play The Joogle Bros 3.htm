<br>No just kidding Joogle update.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0001.png">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/chuchino/m31.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/m.png"> Super Mario 64 - Koopa's Road</a>
<br>
<br>Here were are in INHERTZ FACTORY also known as LAB No. X. I guess 
they switched to Roman numerals for some reason. I don't even know why 
that's there because this area is completely separate from and unrelated
 to the other labs.
<br>
<br>Below us is a "Flagon", a Blagon which is immune to shots from the 
Fire Key which we don't even have yet, and they're really easy to dodge 
anyways so who cares.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0002.png">
<br>In the corner we see some red things with sunglasses? I never 
actually knew what these were called so I asked vgperson and she told me
 they were "Living Suns". What.
<br>
<br>Anyways they're sort of annoying to screenshot because if you get 
anywhere near them they explode into 8 bullets. These bullets do as much
 damage as Gunner bullets so they're basically worthless. Joogle enemies
 tend to either be really annoying or have no reason to exist.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0003.png">
<br>There's a Gunner hidden behind this coin. That's nice. Up ahead some guy says that Belvice knows the Earth Key is underground:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0004.png">
<br>That's not a typo, it's an old MSN injoke. But of course nobody who 
played this would know that and they would think it's a typo. Anyways 
the moral of this story is that Joogle's writing is pretty bad most of 
the time.
<br>
<br>This guy also tells us the door has a skull shaped keyhole (but he 
couldn't fit his head in there). I guess we need to find a key...  a <i>Skull Key?</i> We'll come back here much later.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0005.png">
<br>So here we get the Air Key back. In keeping with the Joogle theme of
 not making any sense, Belvice stole the key but instead of keeping it 
with him he left it on a random pedestal in a factory somewhere. Okay.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0006.png">
<br>So we backtrack to here. I'd screenshot more of this but there's 
really not much that's interesting, at all. If you're wondering what's 
to the left of the Air Key area, it's an entirely pointless shaft with 
some Living Suns, coins, and lava at the bottom. I think it was going to
 be an entrance to another area at some point but I guess not.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0007.png">
<br>Here's something that's fun to do. If you get a health upgrade and 
land in spikes, you will be repeatedly damaged by them even while the 
text box is up.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0008.png">
<br>The end of the level is right beyond these machines. Here's what happens when you jump in lava:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0009.png">
<br>You fall off the screen and then get the normal death screen, which I
 don't think I've shown before but it's a black screen with a "Do you 
want to try again?" textbox at the bottom. I think this is the only 
thing in the game that gives you a death animation of any sort when you 
die; running out of health otherwise just takes you straight to that 
screen. Pilid's death sprite is purple for some reason. 
<br>
<br>The switch machines, like so many other things in this game, are 
pretty much pointless because the exit is directly to the right, taking 
us to the official start of CHAPTER 2:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0010.png">
<br><a href="http://vgperson.com/joogle/chuchino/m32.mid"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/m.png"> Sonic Advance 2 - Hot Crater Zone Act 1</a>
<br>
<br>Although it really starts when you go to Inhertz Factory but you don't get a cool intro picture thing until now.
<br>
<br>KING SURN is waiting for us once again to outline what we have to do in this chapter:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0011.png">
<br><i><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/s.gif">: If he gets it, the volcano beneath the village will erupt! Probably.
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/s.gif">: You must find the Fire Key before Belvice does. It should be in the Fire Chambers below this area.
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/s.gif">: But how could you get there?... There's all this lava in the way. You might want to find a way to drain it.
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/s.gif">: I do believe I heard something about a special switch in this village that could do that... well, I'm sure you two can do it.</i>
<br>
<br>This is probably the most boring chapter in the game. Fortunately it's also really short.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0012.png">
<br>This is the entrance to the Fire Chambers which are apparently 
completely filled with lava. To get past this sophisticated security 
system you have to solve a stupid crate puzzle in some random place. 
That's for next update though (coming sometime in 2008).
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0013.png">
<br>We switch to Pilid and start going up these platforms. By the way this area is called "Inhertz Village". 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0014.png">
<br>At this point Mitch gave up on having the platforms be held up by 
columns and decided to have random floating staircases, much to my 
disappointment. It's hard to suspend your disbelief and become immersed 
in the world of The Joogle Bros. with glaring inconsistencies like this.
 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0015.png">
<br>At the top of the staircases we can go left or right. To the right 
we find this giant pile of rocks and a green Joogle playing with his 
Pilid action figure and Pilid's Action House Playset™ (batteries not 
included).
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0016.png">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0017.png">
<br>Those crazy kids.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0018.png">
<br>So we head back over to the left because we need to find a way to destroy this rock pile.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0019.png">
<br>The Joogle Bros. is brought to you in part by Monkey Cheese of Doom. *waves spork*
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0020.png">
<br>Here we have the shop, one of two vaguely house-like structures in this village.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0021.png">
<br>Now I may have previously stated that all the items in this game are
 useless, but I'm not giving them enough credit. The Speed Shoes are 
very useful because they make you run faster, which is always a good 
thing in games like Joogle (boring games). And the Super Wings let you 
skip large portions of some levels. Everything else sucks though.
<br>
<br>The weird gray things are scenery objects being drawn over the shop text!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0022.png">
<br>We get past a bunch of spikes and then we fall down here, to the 
other vaguely house-like structure which has some weird cannons on it, 
each of which looks like 4 cannons welded together (for four times the 
power). And apparently Joogle and Pilid are travelling together at all 
times, but can only switch at switching machines??? Anyways this guy 
wants 100 coins to destroy the giant rock pile with his cannons. So we 
pay him.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0023.png">
<br>And then he disappears. I'm going to assume it's because we didn't 
want to write dialogue for him to say after you've fired the cannons 
because pretty much everything in Joogle that seems arbitrary like this 
was motivated by laziness. 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0024.png">
<br>This switch is stupid. It makes some walls disappear somewhere that let you get a gold coin. Who cares? Coins are stupid.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0025.png">
<br>So the rocks are destroyed and we can move on to the next area. By 
the way, if you use Super Wings and Speed Shoes, you can follow the 
cannon shots across the map and discover that not only is the rock pile 
destroyed as soon as you pay the money, but the shots would miss anyways
 because the cannons are placed too low. Joogle Quality. 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros%203_files/j0026.png">
<br>See you next update!

<br><br><hr>

<br><b>vgperson:</b>
<br>Actually, making that guy disappear but still having that last text 
box was really annoying and I think there's functions specifically for 
when this guy disappears (even though he could have just been made 
invisible??).
<br>
<br>So I have no idea why we did it. Probably to avoid explaining what the frick is up with that guy.
