<a href="http://vgperson.com/games/JoogleFinal.zip">The Joogle Bros.</a>
 is an RPG/Platformer hybrid that EX-tra Games began development on back
 in 2005. With its catchy marketing slogan "Ir Is Gomirg", The Joogle 
Bros. became one of the most anticipated games of all time, with around 5
 people who actually enjoyed the shitty demo for some reason eagerly 
wairing to play it. But upon its release in March 2008, after almost 
three years of development, it did not live up to the insanely high 
expectations critics had for it and was ultimately considered a failure.
 So what happened to the so-called "Best Game Ever"? Where did the 
developers go wrong? As a lead designer on the project, I'm here to not 
answer any of those questions, but I might do so accidentally while I 
play through it and make fun of it. Here's the first update!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0001.png">
<br>Welcome to The Joogle Bros.! Which will henceforth be referred to as
 simply "Joogle". We're going to be starting a "New Game". But before we
 can play, we have to watch the intro cutscene, starring some mostly 
identical colored blobs and a weird gray thing.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0002.png">
<br><i>The King of the City is Surn. He was once the head of the Joogle 
Army until it was decided he could take up the throne. Second in command
 is Joogle the 38th.
<br>
<br>Unlike previous Joogles, Joogle the 38th had a brother named Pilid. Pilid became the leader of the army once Surn became King.</i>
<br>
<br>To summarize: Joogle is a game about a Joogle named Joogle who lives
 in Joogle City on Planet Joogle and his brother commands the Joogle 
Army. There's also KING SURN who is very important to the plot.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0003.png">
<br>In one of Joogle's many shocking plot twists, the gray thing is revealed to be a rocket. Okay. Suddenly!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0004.png">
<br><i><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/b.gif">: You two! Tell me where the Keys of Joogle are!
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j.gif"><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/p.gif">: The Keys of Joogle? Why, they're scattered all over this world... it would take years to find them!
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/b.gif">: ...Hmmph. I don't have that long. 
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/b.gif">: Regardless, I will rule this world! So I will need all the help I can get...
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/b.gif">: Go and get me the keys!</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0005.png">
<br>Using powerful magic and built-in GM special effects, the strange 
gray Joogle turns all the other Joogles into sideways versions of 
himself and also disappears. Joogle and Pilid, unaffected thanks to 
their anti-purple armor, decide to go tell KING SURN about what's going 
on.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0006.png">
<br><i><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/s.gif">: His name is Belvice. He goes from planet to planet, destroying one after the other for fun!
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/s.gif">:
 He is very powerful... if he gets a hold of the keys, controllers of 
the elements, he could not only destroy our world but command it. Joogle
 and Pilid, you must stop him at all costs!
<br><img id="nolp" src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/s.gif">: Both of you, follow me, and I shall lead you to the Air Key.</i>
<br>
<br>And so begins CHAPTER 1:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0007.png">
<br>I have no idea what those things in the background are supposed to 
be. I asked vgperson, the artist responsible for this picture, for some 
clarification:
<br>
<br>vgperson says:
<br>buildings?
<br>vgperson says:
<br>i guess?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0008.png">
<br>First we have a stupid tutorial level. It's long and has lot of 
textboxes that appear out of nowhere to give you hot tips like "If you 
run out of health you die."
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0009.png">
<br>It may look like Joogle has developed wheels, but sadly this is not 
the case. These are in fact the particle effects that appear when you 
slam (by pressing down) into cracked blocks and break them.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0011.png">
<br>This is one of two utterly pointless walls that starts to fade out 
when you get close to it and will block your path for a second or so if 
you try to rush through too fast. I honestly can't think of any reason 
for them existing. Also the gray guys are called "Blagons".
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0012.png">
<br>Here's where Joogle introduces its core gameplay mechanic: character switching.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0013.png">
<br>Pilid is twice as fast as Joogle, but has half as much health. You 
will have to switch between Joogle and Pilid many times throughout the 
game to solve complex puzzles, like "get through this door that only 
Joogle can enter" or "jump over this gap that only Pilid is fast enough 
to jump over."
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0014.png">
<br>I didn't notice this until now, but if you zoom in really closely 
each key has a little design on it that represents its element. This 
would be cool if it was actually possible to see. Thanks vgperson.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0015.png">
<br>But it's actually not all he has to teach you because there are two 
more textboxes after this telling you about the areas up ahead: The 
Labs, the Hidden Entry To The Air Chamber Beyond The Labs, and The 
Sewers. After that though, you can enter...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0017.png">
<br>JOOGLABS
<br>
<br>This is LAB No. 1 as you can see from the ugly looking sign. There 
are also some brown things which are supposed to be coins, used 
primarily to buy items that you will never use because Mitch wanted to 
have shops in this game for some reason. Below them there's a Hint 
Joogle! Let's see what he has to say!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0018.png">
<br>Thanks Hint Joogle. 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0019.png">
<br>Down here is the sewers, but you can't do anything in them until 
after the third chapter or something. You may have noticed I switched to
 Pilid; that's because he's much faster that Joogle which makes him 
extremely useful because this game is really boring and you'll want to 
get through it as quickly as possible. I'll pretty much never use Joogle
 unless I am forced to, which unfortunately happens a lot.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0020.png">
<br>Joogle is an RPG/Platformer hybrid, and you can't have an RPG without fetch quests!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0021.png">
<br>Here we see a useful sign reminding us that were are still in LAB 
No. 1, as well as some fetuses or something. But more importantly 
there's a STAR EGG. If you collect every STAR EGG in the game you'll get
 to see the secret ending, which you definitely want to see. I can't 
reach this one now, but I'll backtrack and pick it up later.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0022.png">
<br>Key card! It's very big.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0023.png">
<br>The "doors" are that random collection of floating gray blocks surrounding you.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0024.png">
<br>EVERY TIME you collect a health pickup in this game a textbox 
appears telling you that you got one followed by another textbox to 
inform you that it restored 50% of your health. EVERY TIME.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0025.png">
<br>'Clicker'! Remember that one?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0026.png">
<br>After a bit more level we reach LAB No. 5.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0027.png">
<br>...Or not? This "cryogenically frozen" line was rewritten several times but it still doesn't make any sense.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0028.png">
<br>Here you have to switch to Pilid to make this jump. We considered 
having both a Joogle and Pilid switching machine here but decided it 
might be too difficult for players to figure out which one to use. This 
was only the first area; we couldn't put all our hardest puzzles in it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0029.png">
<br>This guy survived the Blagon attacks by hiding under some breakable 
blocks. The tube-fetus was not so lucky. For some reason he decides to 
tell you about how much damage spikes do.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0030.png">
<br>UPDRAFTS
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0031.png">
<br>What the fuck is that supposed to mean.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0032.png">
<br>MORE UPDRAFTS
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0033.png">
<br>Uuuum.
<br>
<br>I can't go down because of UPDRAFTS so I die to spikes. Fortunately 
this area is short and doesn't take long to beat again. Right after this
 I slam down and enter...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0034.png">
<br>LAB No. 2, which is the third Lab section, which comes after LAB No. 5. Yep.
<br>
<br>This was the first level I designed for Joogle. I wrote some pretty hilarious NPC dialogue, as seen below:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0035.png">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0036.png">
<br>Ha ha! Get it? No legs! 
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0037.png">
<br>This level presents you with a strategic character selection 
opportunity. Do you want more health (Joogle), or more speed (Pilid)? 
You want more speed, you moron. Joogle is terrible.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0038.png">
<br>In the first half of this level you avoid a lot of Blagons. Fun!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/jogel.gif">
<br>Here we see another key hologram, and the <i>only moving NPC in the entire game.</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0039.png">
<br>In the second half you avoid a lot of spikes, which are like Blagons but they look different and don't move.
<br>
<br>At the top is the exit. But first, some more zany dialogue:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0040.png">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0041.png">
<br>Oh man, you thought he was going to save your game but he didn't! Isn't that hilarious? I hate myself.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20The%20Joogle%20Bros._files/j0042.png">
<br>See you next update!
