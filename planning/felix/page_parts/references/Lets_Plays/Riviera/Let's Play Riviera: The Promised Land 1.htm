<br>What's this? Well, hey, these guys are pretty cool, so it can't be too bad.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0001.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Also these guys.

<br>Outs!de of th!s game, ! don't know who these guys are.

<br>Also known as Celestia and the Netherworld. Intro summary: Ragnarok 
is a war between gods and demons (what am I?), demons overrun Asgard, 
gods create Grim Angels with Diviners which end up winning the war. And 
then the gods disappear for some reason.
<br>
<br>1000 years later, the people in Riviera get in one little fight and 
get scared and the Seven Magi decide to start the Retribution, which is 
some kind of really powerful. And they figured the best people for the 
job would be the Grim Angels.
<br>

<br>Well, this game is pretty cool. So let's play it.
<br>
<br>Upon Game Starting, we get basically the same intro but in a small font, faster, and with less dramatic scrolling.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0006.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Not for us! Wait, who are we?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0007.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Normally I'd assume this was a girl, but if Golden Sun has taught me
 anything, it's that the pitch of the text typing sound always indicates
 gender.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0008.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Yes, Ein, the name of this game. Um, I mean, Metal Gear?!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0009.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Gee, I wonder which of these two I'm controlling.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0010.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This game seems to really like inversion effects. I didn't take a screen of the chapter intro, but that inverts too.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0011.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Here's Rose, a cat who's supposedly not a cat. Even though she 
(extremely high-pitched text typing!) says "meow" a lot. You're not 
fooling me, Rose.
<br>
<br>Actually, wait, maybe I'm thinking of Lunar. We'll see?
<br>
<br>Ein and Ledah (clumsily) introduce their Diviners as Einherjar and 
Lorelei, and Rose explains that they're the weapons used by Grim Angels,
 a fact we <i>already knew.</i> What a team.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0012.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>One strange thing about Riviera's battle system is that you get an 
inventory of 16 items, but you have to pick four before each battle and 
those are the only ones you can use. And that includes weapons.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0013.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Of course, we only have two items right now, so this is hardly a problem. Yes, we <i>do</i> have infinite Einherjars and Loreleis. I'll get to that.
<br>
<br>In our first battle, Ledah shows he's way too powerful for my current party, having 500 more health than Ein, <i>autohealing,</i> and a weapon 50... units stronger than Ein's. Also, Ein can use Lorelei, but it does like 10 damage, how weak.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0014.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ledah <i>refuses</i> to use Einherjar, however. He's just a badass like that.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0015.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>See? Pawprint. I'm onto you, Rose.
<br>
<br>...Wait, how do you pronounce a pawprint?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0016.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Hector is basically our boss, and one of the Seven Magi. He really 
wants to make sure we hurry to Riviera so we can clear out the demons.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0017.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Moving on the map is... different. In Move mode, it shows exits and 
you press that direction on the D-Pad to take them. In Look mode, it 
shows things to inspect and you press that direction to look at them. 
Looking requires certain amounts of TP, which you earn from doing good 
in battles. So let's look at this.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0018.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This is pretty much all we get out of it. Then Rose tells you to 
hurry up. Yeah. I'm pretty sure you can't, say, farm for TP, so I'm glad
 I have savestates. The Faded Floor in the next room just makes Ein 
comment about the war, and we don't need political commentary in this 
LP.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0019.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This Gremlin guy uses a BREAK OUT, which is in no way used in any 
other game. There was a screen saying "Break Out" but I figured showing a
 midget causing an earthquake with a tiny hammer would make a better 
screenshot.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0020.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Here's Ein pretending to be badass like Ledah. Except we actually <i>did</i>
 pick Einherjar. Anyway, the point is they won't let me use it because 
that Break Out did a lot of damage and I'm forced to use a Potion, since
 this is a tutorial.
<br>
<br>Of course, Ledah is too good for Potions and just says "Lorelei is 
all I need" if you try to give him one. This would make sense since he 
has autoheal, but it's not just potions, he won't use ANYTHING that 
isn't Lorelei.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0021.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>So, anyway, about our infinite Diviners. We can use them infinite 
times because otherwise we'd be defenseless soon enough. However, every 
other item has limited uses before it breaks, or in Potion's case, runs 
out of... potion. Yes, even weapons that aren't Diviners.
<br>
<br>In the next screen, Rose explains Look Mode while Ein breaks the 
fourth wall a lot. Well, he's said stuff like "the R button? I'll 
remember that" before, but now he's mentioning the "corner of the 
screen" and it just sounds wrong. This time we need to look at a ledge 
to find a way onward.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0022.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Like so.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0023.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>You and your grammar.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0024.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein has no concept of being normal. We learn about Over Skills, which we learn by using a weapon more.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0025.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Notice how we have two separate potions. No, we can't combine them. I
 mean, in theory, a 3-use Potion is full, so 5 uses wouldn't fit in one 
bottle.
<br>
<br>Of course, logically, you should be able to combine 1- and 2-use Potions, but who's really going to bother coding that?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0026.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Anyway, Over Skills. Einherjar now has an Exp bar, so we have to use it two times to learn an Over Skill at the end of battle.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0027.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I got a rock for inspecting a Pile of Rubble. So useless. Load -
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0028.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>...Oh. Well, I do like to score.
<br>
<br>Rose asks Ein if he gets tired walking since he's an angel, but he 
reveals he doesn't have wings because he gave them up to get his 
Diviner. Ledah <s>four</s> three-dots when Rose asks what he gave up for Lorelei.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0029.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I'd make a comment about how foreboding this is because I seem to 
remember there being a billion and a half trapped chests later, but I 
really can't remember for sure.
<br>
<br>We inspect some more rubble blocking our way and walk away, but suddenly, Ein turns around and notices...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0030.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>It's just too easy to make fun of Ein.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0031.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Mana Wisps have something to do with Sprites and add one to all our stats. Well, at least this one does.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0032.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I shouldn't have screenshotted this. The more important line is the 
one that follows it: "Besides, without me, you're hopeless." Burn.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0033.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein's responses are always more entertaining than the lines he's 
responding to. Anyway, we press Left to use Over Skills, and also we 
have to fill up an Overdrive meter first.
<br>
<br>However, I decided to use Lorelei's Over Skill, Lost Seraph, first. It <i>shattered the meter.</i> They keep making Ledah more and more badass.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0034.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0035.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Seems the game didn't expect me to do that.
<br>
<br>We inspect the path ahead and a spider comes down. Rose suggests we throw our rock at it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0037.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>QUICK TIME EVENT. The arrow is moving, obviously. You're not 
actually timed, but I'm pretty sure you are for later ones. We get a 
Spider Web and 10000 points for hitting the spider. I knew I'd need that
 rock.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0038.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Hey, the game is insulting <i>Ledah</i> for once! (Actually, it says
 this for everything except Lorelei. I just didn't notice until I looked
 to see what Spider Web did.)
<br>
<br>After this battle, we talk about the Retribution, which will 
apparently just completely destroy Riveria, but hey, that's where all 
the demons are! Ein wants to save the Sprites there, but apparently they
 worked for demons or something, so Ledah doesn't care.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0039.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I missed the far more appopriate screenshot of "No one asked you to think." Man, Hector is kind of a jerk.
<br>
<br>Ein looks at a rock step and notes that it's about to break. So what should he do with it?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0040.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Brilliant ideas, Ein. Of course, for the sake of this LP, we hit it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0041.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Riviera has kind of a bad screen-shaking effect. It's only two 
frames of the background moving up and down, and as you can see, there's
 just a line of black when it moves down. A boulder falls!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0042.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Well, we're <i>already</i> being timed during these. That's not a 
good sign. If we do this correctly, we jump really high in a really 
silly way to dodge the boulder. 5000 points!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0043.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Taking Rose's advice, Ein logically...
<br>
<br>...
<br>
<br>Ein: <i>Should I pull it out?</i>
<br>
<br>For this event, we have to mash A 12 times before time runs out. 
Dragon Killer, 3000 points, etc. This also makes us stronger somehow.
<br>
<br>We jump onto a platform supported by chains which starts falling and we fight a dragon.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0044.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Dragon Killer... dragon. Hmmm.
<br>
<br>We're still falling, but manage to jump to a ledge with another Stop (Arrow) at 500 event.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0045.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>But... but I got an S rank!
<br>
<br>Right as Rose is wondering if they'll run into any more demons they run into some more demons.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0046.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I can just imagine some guy at Atlus thinking about how to translate
 this, slapping himself for thinking of what we see here, and using it 
anyway but fully admitting to the player that he shouldn't have.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0047.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>A what? Since we really like bells I guess we do a button sequence event to grab it for points and Angel's Bell.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0048.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Exactly what I was thinking, Rose. 49 screenshots already? Of 
course, Riviera has more interesting things to show than Golden Sun's 
ungodly boring intro.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0049.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Rose asks Ledah about what he gave up for Lorelei again. I'm not 
really sure I want to know anymore. And then they're interrupted by 
another battle with demons.
<br>
<br>Ein notices some cracks and we pull a sword out of them. A Rosier! What the heck is a Rosier?
<br>
<br>Then we run into a fairy, which suddenly makes Ledah want to hurry 
up. He doesn't want to take her, but we do anyway and get healed and 
powered up. And points. Most importantly, points.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%201_files/riviera0050.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>We can't pass? Well, I guess that makes this a good place to stop!
