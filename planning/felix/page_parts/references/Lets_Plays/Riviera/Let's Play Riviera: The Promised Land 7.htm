<br>Last time on Riviera: The Promised Land, we finished the game. 
Obviously, this update is nothing but massive amounts of post-game 
content.
<br>
<br>There's nothing really going on around town. There's just so many 
people saying "good job you're awesome go peace" that if I screenshotted
 them all, I'd run out of clever jokes about it actually being the end 
of the game. (Which it is.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0323.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Well, except this syllable-fairy...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0324.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Gotta love this game. Also we give the nearby witch the Light Moss but don't get anything yet. Which means we never will, right?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0325.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>WORK SURE IS WORK. Man, <s>ice</s> fairies are so stupid.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0326.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I disagree. That is extremely bad.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0327.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Then the elder hypnotises Ein and turns out to be evil. No not really.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0328.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0329.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>When an emotionless Grim Angel, who was up to no good, started 
destroying Aquariums in the Yggdrasilhood. Oh, and something about it 
possibly (that is, obviously) being Ledah.
<br>
<br>So in the morning, no one actually knows where Yggdrasil is, so we ask the elder. It's...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0330.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Hold on, you're confusing me here.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0331.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>...Um. I thought there was another chapter after this. So what the heck is that named?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0332.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>And with him, Meteor.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0333.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Wow Ursula sounds really evil if you just look at that line. Anyway 
she's released THE CEFIRO to slow down not-Ledah and to actually make 
Ein fight some enemies before not-Ledah.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0334.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I'm pretty sure this sentence doesn't actually make grammatical sense.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0335.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I figured I should probably screenshot this, but I don't really have
 anything clever to say about it, so I'll comment on how bad the y in 
"Fairy" looks since they didn't bother to program letter hooks for 
names. Anyway, we run into some CEFIRO.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0336.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Wait, at what point did we realize that it's obviously Ledah? Not 
that I'm complaining about being able to stop calling him not-Ledah, but
 when did it happen?
<br>
<br>We check a bush and find the fairies. They want us to take them to their friend. Yeah sure.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0337.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Better than inside your brain, I suppose. (That was a Seiken Densetsu 3 joke you probably didn't get it.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0338.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>No, really. vg's fine with third-person, but this is just poor grammar.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0339.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>For some reason this made me think of Megaman disappearing blocks instead of something else about magic floating blocks.
<br>
<br>Which turns out to be quite appropriate because AIR MAN ATTACKS
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0340.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>What kind of right-pressing action is "gust"? We're trying to not get blown away by wind here, in case you couldn't guess.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0341.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Did Lina always have grammar this bad also great it's one of those jerk wind dragons again. So his Break Out blows us away.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0342.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>After we get back Ein doesn't pay attention to Fia or something 
which makes everyone suddenly complain about how he should care about 
them since they're his friends. But seriously no one cares.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0343.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Then we get to see Ledah beating up CEFIRO. Looks like Ledah is shedding.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0344.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Not you, too. (She's talking about the trees or something.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0345.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Lina gets getting really emotional about having to beat up Ledah, 
but we all know Ledah was too much of a badass for Ein to actually 
consider him a friend.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0346.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0347.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This is actually a lot more obvious when you can see the animation 
of the silhouette. (It's a fairy, and apparently if you throw a rock at 
it, you can never collect it. Whoops?)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0348.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>HOW DOES THIS CORRESPOND TO THROWING A ROCK
<br>
<br>On the way, Ein has plenty more emotional/anime talks about with his
 party about WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A GRIM ANGEL and THE POWER OF 
FRIENDSHIP. They also eventually figure out that breaking Aquariums is 
bad because it makes all the fish die.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0349.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>A fairy in a chest? What is this, Majora's Mask?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0350.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>So anyway. she joins us too.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0351.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>You're a kitty!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0352.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>...Uh. What?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0353.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>OH NO
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0354.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0355.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Grim Angels are evil who could have guessed. It's not like they're called GRIM ANGELS OR ANYTHING
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0356.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Dramatic!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0357.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Well he's dead. But Ein won't finish him.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0358.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh hey completely forgot about you. Turns out she's a Grim Angel.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0359.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0360.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>You're sounding like a Stage 5 boss. (Also she's talking about Hector. You probably forgot him too.)
<br>
<br>So Ledah says he's going to be okay and we chase Malice.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0361.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Heavy, dude.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0362.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Geez, Rose, we can totally take down God.
<br>
<br><i>Ein: Rose, I've been thinking...</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0363.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Maybe it's just me, but I think Rose hasn't been doing nearly enough
 of this lately. Anyway, Ein basically just says he's determined to stop
 Hector and so on.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0364.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh, whoops.
<br>
<br>So now Ursula isn't protected, but we're still here so let's fight.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>After the battle even though she lost Malice is about to kill us for real this time seriously EXCEPT...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0365.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>OH NO YOU DI'INT. Then I guess Malice stabs Ledah.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0366.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>well okay
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0367.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>He also reveals that he gave up his emotions to become a Grim Angel. Yeah we sorta already figured all that out, Ledah. Ledah?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0368.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0369.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>The antithesis of Ursula is named... Seth? Seriously? That's really something. Also, uh, <i>so is the Maze of Shadows the opposite of Yggdrasil</i> or something.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%207_files/riviera0370.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>That's really something, too.
