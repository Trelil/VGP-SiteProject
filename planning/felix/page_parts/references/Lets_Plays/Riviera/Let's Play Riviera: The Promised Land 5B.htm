<font size="5"><b>Let's Play Riviera: Bonus Update</b></font><br>

<br>So, since I'm such an expert at all things Riviera, it VERY RECENTLY
 came to my attention that it was not originally a Game Boy Advance 
game. No, much like Final Fantasy 1+2, it was originally for the 
Wonderswan.
<br>
<br>You know, the Wonderswan. Gunpei Yokoi made it, you should know what it is... don't you?
<br>
<br>Of course. Anyway, let's have a quick look at how things changed in the port.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0200.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Unfortunately, since the Wonderswan is much more powerful than the GBA, my <i>definitely real hardware</i> isn't good enough to properly render some things. As you can see, the font is all messed up.
<br>
<br>Fortunately, this is not a problem, as not only have I memorized all
 the dialogue, but I figured out how to interpret the glitchy text. It 
would be a huge hassle to edit all these images, but I'll tell you the 
important changes.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0201.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>This image may shock many players of the GBA version: yes, Ledah's 
name is now Ecthel. However, to make up for this, he is much more manly 
and transparent than before. And by before I mean in the future.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0202.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Oh god I can't even joke about this. Ein just looks terrible. I 
suppose it still kind of looks like the sprite (none of which changed), 
but geez. I swear, Ein better get a manlier portrait after Chapter 1, 
because no one can be attracted to this.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0203.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Hector... well, he actually looks <b>less</b> like a little kid wearing cloak thing that's too big for him. Huh.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0204.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Also, Look Mode is now QUEST MODO The GBA version has no sense of adventure.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0205.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Roze has BAT WINGS but still forces Ein to use Potions, so nothing's changed there.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0206.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Okay, glitch-interpreting time: Ein has a great concern for the Y2K 
bug, which was no longer relevant at the time of the GBA rerelease and 
thus was removed.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0207.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>This glitch doesn't affect the strangest spots. Also, serious 
comment - has that ALWAYS said "ULTIMA!!"? I'm pretty sure that never 
said ULTIMA!!.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0208.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Not much to say except Ledah probably has the least bad-looking 
portraits. Well, Roze has bat wings, but Ledah is actually SUPPOSED to 
be badass.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0209.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Roze tells us to Move Modotte. But it's a typo; she really wants us 
to Move Modo Tei. So I guess Tewi is telling me not to pick Easy Modo, 
which I must have accidentally done before I realized how the text 
glitch worked. Well, too late now.
<br>
<br>Also jesus I swear the GBA version explains this in far fewer text 
boxes. You can tell I was bored during this explanation because of how 
long and unfunny the above line was.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0210.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Oh god Roze stop being terrifying I know I'm out of TP.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0211.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Good old rock. Nothing beats rock.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0212.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>OH GOD WHICH BUTTON IS A I'M NOT ACTUALLY SURE
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0213.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>I've failed you, Ein.
<br>
<br>And then I failed him two more times. Seriously, the Wonderswan's controls make no sense.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0214.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>...And then the sword broke. Well, it couldn't have been that good, 
then! Our (lack of) A-mashing is more powerful than any sword.
<br>
<br>And then a lot of non-interesting things happened. Who could have 
guessed I wouldn't have much to say about the first chapter of the 
original version of a game I've already LPed the first chapter of, 
except this time I can't read anything?
<br>
<br>The chiptune music is pretty good, though. You should use whatever legal methods possible to listen to it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0215.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Oh yeah, and Lilith is called Riris. Was called. Whatever. Anyway I 
have no idea why they changed it to something as outlandish as "Lilith."
<br>
<br>SO WE FINALLY GOT TO THE END OF THE CHAPTER.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0216.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>At least the Sacred Tongue isn't glitched. It still doesn't make sense, though.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0217.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>The Accursed, too, will not fall victim to a mere glitch.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0218.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Ein gets teleported away and something goes wrong with his eye.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0219.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Fia! You're... exactly the same with weirder colors.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0220.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Unfortunately, Lina's name has been changed to ?????. But she's still awesome.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0221.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>What the hell are you doing Ein.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0222.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Of course I remember your name, Kyua.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205B_files/riviera0223.gif" width="448" height="288">
<br>Was that cat always there?
<br>
<br>Well, I'm saving and stopping for now. Will I ever do this again? Probably not.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>EDIT:
<br>
<br>So, uh.
<br>
<br>Apparently, the Wonderswan only came out in Japan.
<br>
<br>And also, it failed miserably, so almost all of the five (at most) good games for it got ported to better systems.
<br>
<br>I still don't know why all the text was glitched, though.
