<br>Took long enough.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0052.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Pfft, close enough. Ledah must edit Wikipedia or something.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0053.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Apparently Hector knows this girl and tells us she's our enemy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0054.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Huhwhat.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0055.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>The Sacred Tongue looked kind of like Russian. Anyway, she's trying 
to stop us from activating the Retribution for the sake of the Sprites. 
Ledah's already established he hates Sprites, so we fight her dragon.
<br>
<br>Ein dies pretty fast since it's really strong, but still not strong enough to outdo Ledah's autoheal.
<br>
<br>After the fight, the dragon dies and Ledah tries to kill Ursula.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0056.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh, well. Then Ein gets teleported away.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0057.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Game over, man, game over.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0058.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This would be like a double game over if we happened to care for any
 Sprites, but now why would we do a silly thing like that. Anyway, it 
turns out we're alive and surrounded by fairies.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0059.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Bad idea, lady.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0060.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein is so forgetful we're not sure if he's even still Ein.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0061.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Hey, I got both of their names in one screen. So yeah we got found by these two girls.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0062.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Personally, I would scream if I woke up to that face.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0063.gif" width="480" height="320">

<br>And so it begins. We're in Elendia, which is a town in Riviera.
<br>
<br>Ein: <i>Riviera?!</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0066.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein, I made that joke at the end of the Golden Sun LP. Did you forget that?
<br>
<br>Oh, right. Yeah, Ein has amnesia, of course he forgot.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0067.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Um?
<br>
<br>When we talk to the green-haired girl, we have to remember her name.
 Well, it's a good thing I took that screenshot with both of their names
 in it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0068.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>...What? Really? You're <i>not</i> Chia? Okay that never happened.
<br>
<br>We look at the table and look at the bread on the table. Chia doesn't seem to be using it, so...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0069.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein knows what you gotta have in life.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0070.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh god the options. It doesn't especially help all the houses use this exact background.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0071.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Insert Super Mario Galaxy joke.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0072.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Lina got a heart because I told her "yes, thanks for asking" in 
response to "are you okay?" Also, she talks in the third person 
sometimes. Both of these indicate that she's crazy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0073.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I believe she's rolling her eyes here.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0074.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Very clever, Atlus.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0075.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Get away from me.
<br>
<br>Less important stuff in town: everyone is worried about demons (not 
allied with them!) and the fairy Ein met in Chapter 1 remembers him but 
neglects to mention he's an angel or anything.
<br>
<br>We're eventually able to go to the elder's house where Fia and Lina 
complain about him cancelling the expedition to Rosalina Island, since 
they lost contact with the Arcs there.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0076.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Lina is especially angry. They decide to just go there on their own 
via a magic circle. Since they're Fia and Lina, I have to follow them 
even though they say not to. They're surprisingly willing to let me 
come, though.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0077.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Meanwhile, Hector is being a huge jerk with Ledah and looking for 
Ursula. Hector also mentions something about Malice collecting and 
sacrificing souls, which doesn't sound very godly.
<br>
<br><b>CHAPTER 2: PURSUIT OF TRUTH</b>
<br>(don't expect my chapters to follow the ingame ones at all)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0078.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Apparently Potions aren't just a heavenly technology, because Fia can make Potions, being skilled with weeds.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0079.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Lina points out some wet grass where she finds a dagger. Since being
 nice to Lina is always better than being mean to her, we tell her it's a
 nice find rather than saying it's broken and not that useful. This also
 lets us actually have the dagger.
<br>
<br>We run into demons and Fia mentions the front and back lines.
<br>
<br>Ein: <i>Back line? Front line?</i>
<br>Lina: <i>Geez! The back is the back, and the front is the front!</i>
<br>Ein: <i>Um... That I know...</i>
<br>
<br>As far as I know, it doesn't work Final Fantasy style, where people 
in the back are weaker. Enemies attack whoever is in front of them, and I
 assume they also have wide/piercing attacks like I do, so it's kind of 
important I guess.
<br>
<br>After the battle, the girls realize Ein is actually stronger than they are. We search some more grass.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0080.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Who can resist that face? And also points? We're keeping your rock, Lina.
<br>
<br>On the next screen are some briars. If we touch them, Ein and Lina permanently lose max HP. So, uh, let's not do that.
<br>
<br>Lina: <i>But there might be something cool!</i>
<br>Ein: <i>You mean, like a rock?</i>
<br>
<br>The girls get kind of scared because of how creepy the castle looks.
 But we are fearless and ignore their worries, which makes them like us 
more. Okay.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0081.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>We inspect a gargoyle, but it does nothing. We can push Lina to look
 closer, however... and find a trap. But hey, we get points if we dodge 
it. Poooints.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0082.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein: <i>That makes two of us.</i>
<br>Demons appear.
<br>Lina: <i>Demons!</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0083.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Not that there's anything wrong with wearing a ribbon.
<br>
<br>Eventually Fia tells us we can fight Practice battles to level up 
our weapon skills. And they don't use items, which is really nice. And 
we can end these battles anytime, which is also nice, since people lose 
their weapon progress if they die.
<br>
<br>Lina sees something round in a tree. Whatever you say, Lina.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0084.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Extremely realistic shaking physics. A fruit falls and we give it to Lina to give her some stat boosts.
<br>
<br>We hide from a guard via quick time event. However...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0085.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Lina is allergic to guards. But we STOP THE SNEEZE via quick time event. What can't they do?
<br>
<br>We hide from a few more guards, then hear one rustling in the bushes.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0086.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Since I'm not necessarily being <i>mean</i> to Fia, I choose to sneak past. Guess what? Quick time event.
<br>
<br>We run into some posessed bones or something. Fia purifies them with a prayer...
<br>
<br>...A quick time event prayer.
<br>
<br>(By the way, Lina's attempt at handling the situation is attacking the bones, which turns them into a demon. Not so good.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0087.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This guy is a jerk and says this after every hit. Until his turn:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0088.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Whoops. We get separated from Lina and end up on a roof somewhere. 
Ein and Fia fight some demons and meet up with Lina like two screens 
later. But what of the dragon? WHAT OF RIVIERA.
<br>
<br>Well, we get blown away again. Although it takes slightly longer 
before he decides to do it. This time we don't get separated, and when 
we jump down from the roof Lina crashes into a tree.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0089.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This random branch that falls just happens to be useful.
<br>
<br>After we get blown away again, all the dialogue repeats, so <i>this</i>
 time they actually expect us to defeat him. Actually, that's kind of 
incorrect; his HP doesn't regenerate each time you get blown away, and 
he never stops blowing you away, so you just keep taking off HP until 
you kill him before he blows you away. I said "blows you away" and 
variants way too much.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0090.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>La-Mulina? Lina wants this bat so we throw a rock at it.
<br>
<br>Just kidding, that would make her sad. We do like a 10-button long quick time event to catch it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0091.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Mr. Bat is fun for all ages.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0092.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Um, use weapons? At least you haven't forgotten your stupidity. Fia 
explains that there's a bar that shows the damage a weapon will do -
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0093.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>...Never mind. We jump down some roofs and find a slightly catacomby
 place where we light that twig with a blue flame. That's nice.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0094.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein seems strangely troubled by this. But apparently so am I, since 
this is the first thing in several screens I found worth screenshotting.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0095.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>We find a fountain. Since we're smart enough to realize the water is
 probably no good, we just get some water to bring to the Moon Lilies. 
Which we hold with our hands.
<br>
<br>On the way back, Lina starts running and trips, but we decide to 
drop the water and save her because hey, we can get more water. Which we
 do.
<br>
<br>For reviving the Lilies, we get a Moon Drop. Then I decide to use the fountain to put out the torch, which gets me Mosamo Ash.
<br>
<br>And on the way back from THERE some Black Earrings fall out of nowhere. What a nice nowhere.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0096.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Unique character portrait alert! (Actually that means nothing 
because everyone in town has one, although all fairies look the same, 
end racism.)
<br>
<br>...But rather than look for the source of the scream, we search a 
thicket for a four-leaf clover. And Ein finds one. One lucky guy! Well, 
back to looking at those people above us.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0097.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Unique character portrait <i>of a jerk</i> alert. Apparently this 
girl (high pitched text) is the one who killed all the Arcs and is 
trying to kill this one, too. Somehow while fighting they fall down to 
our level and we fight the she-jerk.
<br>
<br>Also, Einherjar is pre-equipped. But that's not important at all.
<br>
<br>The battle goes on for three turns and she-jerk keeps saying "you 
call that fighting?" until she decides to use her Break Out. Then Ein 
randomly sticks out his Einherjar and the battle ends.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%202_files/riviera0098.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Illogical. Logic not found. She-jerk runs away because their 
Diviners are resonating or something. Oh hey and the Arc is still here.
<br>

<br>Not a favorable situation. Serene joins us to take revenge on the demons.
<br>
<br>BUT THEN SUDDENLY
