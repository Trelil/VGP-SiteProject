<font size="5"><b>Let's Play Riviera: Chapter 4</b></font><br>

<br>Let's inspect a statue, we can make it our best friend. Cierra has other ideas, though.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0151.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Since when have we cared about setting demons free? Cierra knows 
nothing of how we operate. No matter what option we choose, it's indeed 
too late.
<br>
<br>For fighting the demons, we get a Book of Nanai. Whatever that is.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0152.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Serene is a jerk.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0153.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I like how there's the intended meaning, and then there's also the 
fact that this appears to be the exact same "cracks" sprite used for the
 ground. We mash B to destroy the wall. Sure, that makes sense.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0154.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This... doesn't, really. Amusingly, Fia says "we can't go back" but 
one of the exits is labeled "back." But in reality it leads to another 
nest.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0155.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>A poor orange stuck in a tree. Lina wants to shoot it down, Serene 
wants to fly to it. We all know who wins. Also, quick time event to aim 
the shot.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0156.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Looks like she hit the tree. Also, it's an Applecot, unsurprisingly.
<br>
<br>For the egg, we can take it, but since we don't really need more 
eggs, we break it (with some kind of karate chop) for points and stat 
boosts.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0157.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Forget the Accursed, Ein's true mission is to travel the world and karate chop every giant egg he can find.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0158.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Of the three dialogue boxes I could have taken a screen of, I chose 
this one because having to type out the correct spelling of this would 
conflict with my style. But yeah, the floor is gross. We can tell Lina 
it tastes good but that's being a jerk because it's fungus.
<br>
<br>We fight some slime demons that are actually worth mentioning 
because every one of their attacks lowers the endurance of your items. 
Magnificent jerks.
<br>
<br>Missed the screenshot since it's pre-battle dialogue I always ignore
 since it's usually just "DEMONS!!", but Serene says "Ein, whatcha gonna
 do?" Really, whatchas Ein <i>always</i> done when demons gonna come for him?
<br>
<br>Anyway, we inspect a Hanging Object and - wait...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0159.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>WHAT IT'S CLEARLY A BEEHIVE WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU
<br>
<br>Serene <i>knocks it down</i> and when Fia <i>tells</i> her it's a beehive Serene doesn't even seem to have a clue what bees <i>are.</i> Jesus. We run by means of quick time event, obviously.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0160.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Once the bees are gone, we can take or burn the - hold on, take?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0161.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Hmmm... nah. Even the friendly Mr. Bat has a chance of biting you 
instead of the enemy, so I'm definitely not trusting killer bees.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0162.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Cierra looks vicious in this portrait. Also there's no quick time 
event or any more dialogue than this or anything, but hey points.
<br>
<br>Cierra almost falls but we quick time rescue her. Ein suggests Serene is lucky to have wings. But do they come off?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0163.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>It almost sounds like she wants to know. For science, of course. Anyway, Serene says she'll save us if we fall.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0164.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>That's Lina thinkin'. We also get another Mana Wisp by Lina shooting
 at it. What can't she do? Ignoring that she isn't able to effectively 
use the majority of our items.
<br>
<br>We come across some kind of root.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0165.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I wonder if we'll do anything like that. Ein tries to pull some out, but it's too strong. So the rest of the party helps.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0166.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This is apparently the sound of Cierra mashing down, because that's what we do in the following quick time event.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0167.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>And these are the best battle results ever.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0168.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>That's a feather. It kind of looks nothing like a feather, but whatever, Lina wants it.
<br>
<br>Even if we want to get it ourselves, Lina and Fia do it for us, and 
somehow have a lot of trouble grabbing it. And then they both fall and 
get covered in mud. Oh, Lina.
<br>
<br>Finally, one screen later...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0169.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>It's our Accursed dude. I don't know if anyone before had it, but 
this guy has a weird distorted text typing sound, which is kind of cool.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0170.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>We beat him and Serene randomly notices a hole. It leads to the same background we've seen like 10 times this chapter.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0171.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh yeah, I forgot about Cierra's metal jointed friend. BUT SUDDENLY THERE IS A MEOWING NOISE.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0172.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Gateau is a cat. Not too surpsiing. But wait, this cat looks familiar. Or should I say... <i>our</i> familiar? (That wasn't intentional, but I still apologize.)
<br>
<br>So yeah, apparently Cierra found Rose in the woods and gave her a 
potion that made her speak cat. We can understand her, though, so our 
party members call us crazy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0173.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>And Ein has bad excuses for things.
<br>
<br>Back in Elendia, Kyle loves using rod actions to bring in a fish. 
Whatever floats your boat. We get a fishing rod for fishing, I guess. 
Then some kid outside gives us a pouch for fishing. What? I don't 
remember any fishing in this game, but I suppose it's to be expected in a
 game with so many quick time events.
<br>
<br>Also, Reiche wants our Dizzyshroom. Uh, sure. Here you go, guy. When you go to jail, you better not tell anyone I gave you this.
<br>
<br>We're done in town, so we go to the Elder.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0174.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Obviously, this means the next Accursed is there.
<br>
<br><b>CHAPTER 4: SUNKEN WISDOM</b>
<br>(i vaguely remember this one? a little?)
<br>
<br>We fight some more slime demons (grrr) and eventually catch a grasshopper with a QTE. This was not screenshot-worthy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0175.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Well, aren't you positive.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0176.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>There are so many things I could say here, so I'm going to surprise you and not say any of them.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0177.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Crazy red and blue bandage girls? They're slightly insane. They also
 want to flood the ruins and kill us because we're dirty demon-killers. 
I'm disappointed the second part of it has to come between us.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0178.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Outside, we can investigate some rocks. Lina tries to jump across 
and somehow pulls EVERYONE ELSE in, drenching our inventory. But we can 
actually just move onward without inspecting the rocks. What the hell.
<br>
<br>This may have been the case for the brick-jumping last chapter as 
well, but this makes you drenched NO MATTER WHAT so it's worse.
<br>
<br>We see a fish in the water and Lina suggests we catch it for Rose. Except Rose refuses to eat raw fish.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0179.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>See, I told you I wasn't mixing this up with Lunar. But yeah, this 
is why we got the fishing equipment in town. And as bait, we use the 
grasshopper. Funny how all this works out. PS. Quick time event.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0180.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I don't think that's proper usage of the verb "fish." We examine a rock, and...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0181.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>For throwing at bats? Sure. I guess I'll take it. (No, I don't think
 there was a rock in Chapter 3, so this is only semi-recurring.)
<br>
<br>We open a chest with a standard, random tra-
<br>
<br>Lina: <i>There's something next to the chest!</i>
<br>Rose: <i>(It's a snake!)</i>
<br>Fia: <i>Ein, a snake!</i>
<br>Ein: <i>Oh, yeah?</i>
<br>EIN PICKS UP AND THROWS THE SNAKE VIA QUICK TIME EVENT.
<br>
<br>The chest has more Tarot cards but seriously Ein just went "oh, 
yeah?!" and threw a snake. No wonder doing this made everyone like him 
more.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0182.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>For reasons everyone but Ein's party knows, the water level is 
rising really quickly. I'd comment on how suddenly it went from no water
 being visible here to where it is now, but...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0183.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>There's this, instead. Are you kidding me?
<br>
<br>Well, something came loose and floated to the top. Some kind of book.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0184.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>No comment.
<br>
<br>We come across a door. Serene wants Cierra to blow it up, but it's &lt;<b></b>insert really strong made-up material&gt;. But there's a strange panel nearby.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0185.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Fia: <i>H-heaviest...</i>
<br>Cierra: <i>...one...</i>
<br>
<br>Apparently even the <i>game</i> doesn't want you to be mean to Lina,
 because Lina only opens the door a little. Anyway, I leave Fia because I
 know she's the fattest.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0186.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Not at all suspicious. Not at all trapped. Not at all obvious.
<br>
<br>...Actually, the blue chests are empty, not trapped, but the green 
one has a key in it. Something about that seems... redundant, I guess.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0187.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>These demons are trying to steal a <s>mermaid's</s> Undine's scales to sell them at a high price to strangers.
<br>
<br>After defeating them, the Undine is gone, so we go back to where we 
left Fia. Fia gives us a Holy Crest, which I expected to toss...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0188.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>But Lina can do this with it. How does that work?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0189.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>The water level rises again and hey, shiny thing. Serene calls Lina 
fat despite what happened no less than ten minutes ago. We end up 
sending Rose to get it and it's a Mana Wisp. Sweet, free stats. I think 
Rose hates me forever, though.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0190.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Nice dodge. We dodge two more (do I even have to say it) and go up to fight the archerdemons who were firing them.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0191.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein goes looking for stuff in a dark room and everyone follows him 
for some reason. I'd say that this used to have a dirty joke that was 
censored, except 1. this is Atlus and 2. all the other ones got in. 
Anyway, we find a key which we quickly use.
<br>
<br>Cut to crazy red and blue girls. They plan to stop us with a Golem. Musical note.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0192.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Leon, I've sent you a Playing Manual. Look on the back of the CD 
case. Submerge it in water. Red girl doesn't think they need the manual,
 though, since the Golem is already on.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0193.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I wonder if the Riviera manual translator had anything to do with the main script.
<br>
<br>We fight another dragon that has an Over Skill that blows us away, 
but there isn't even any amusing plot when it happens, it just wastes 
our Turns Until Drowning. Disappointing.
<br>
<br>Then we catch the Golem Manual via you-know-what.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%204_files/riviera0194.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>And then we end up back in Golden Sun, oh god.
