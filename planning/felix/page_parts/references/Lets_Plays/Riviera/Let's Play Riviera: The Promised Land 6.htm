<br>Couldn't have found a better way to start this off if I tried.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0274.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Since we got mithril earlier (I guess, I barely remember it), he offers to make us some equipment. Okay.
<br>
<br>Over at the Magic Guild, Claude asks us to show him that giant page, and...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0275.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>What, and that isn't useful? <i>Pictures!</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0276.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>It seems like this was here before, but I never looked at it. Seriously is Rose supposed to be a cat or not?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0277.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Apparently Ein hasn't been bathing during my massive break. Oops. 
Sorry. (Anyway, she wants our fish and gives us a Cheer Bell in return.)
<br>
<br>Okay, so we were beating up Recursions or something.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0278.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>(For the last seal, that is. Man, I think I'm actually kinda close to the end.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0279.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>A hole appeared and ghosts came out of it? Doesn't sound likely to me, Lina.
<br>
<br><b>CHAPTER 5: ETERNAL BEINGS</b>
<br>(i don't remember this at all can't we get to the last two already i actually sort of remember those)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0280.gif" width="480" height="320">

<br>Cierra, you still suck at reading.
<br>
<br>While Cierra is being dumb, a guy with a cleaver just sort of shambles into Lina and she loses her backpack.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0282.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Um... geez, I forget who I was being nice/mean to. Anyway.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0283.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><i>Lina: It's already too late for that!</i>
<br>
<br>Except, none of that actually happened. Of course.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0284.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Lina ain't afraid of no ghost, etc.
<br>
<br>Then we fight some demons and look at a dead tree.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0285.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Yep.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0286.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>The Lens of Truth? Cierra suggests using the rope.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0287.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh, wait. You mean to go down the well?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0288.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh yeah, that's right. I was being nice to Lina. Because it's always
 a result of choosing the right option. Fine, we'll go along with your 
silly "secure rope" idea.
<br>
<br>Everybody climbs down, Cierra causes the rope to snap, Ein gets a chance to make fun of Cierra's weight. Standard Riviera fare.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0289.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>And standard Atlus fare, too.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0290.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>After beating those guys, the game makes us waste TP looking at a clearly empty chest. Jerks.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0291.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Since we never learn, we look at another one. For some reason, 
seeing two empty chests is infinitely more annoying to Serene than just 
one, so she throws the chest at the wall.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0292.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh, great. If we check the chest again, we realize we can just hit 
the switch again to turn the lights on. But if we disregard what Lina 
said (and I didn't screenshot) about not being able to go back...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0293.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I really think we should have been able to see that before, honestly. So we take the Light Moss and go the the next area.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0294.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This looks like Ice Priest's stage. Prepare for a disappearing block puzzle.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0295.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0296.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This looks even more ridiculous in motion. I almost missed you, quick time event.
<br>
<br>If we dodge it, we get...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0297.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Most useful item ever.
<br>
<br>So we walk into a maze of some sort and there's a vampire on the ceiling who's like "JOIN US SERENE."
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0298.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I know Serene, and she isn't two-faced.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0299.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0300.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein is a master decision-maker. We touch it and hey who could have 
guessed it's actually a demon. But we don't have to actually fight it, 
because...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0301.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0302.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I'll be nice to Serene just this once if only because "Prune it!" is a great A-button action.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0303.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><i>it's sunny?</i> (I really think they could have fit that in one box but whatever)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0304.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>There's a "pound" and "steak" joke here, but I'll let you make it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0305.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Souls have weights.
<br>
<br>So we go around to three identical rooms, each with a stake and an 
convoluted-puzzle-tombstone, and pound the stakes to open a fangdoor.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0306.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Insert Fire Emblem joke. Anyway, we're Ein, so we're gonna take it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0307.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Hey, you have a perfectly good sword already. After beating him, we 
get his 5-use sword (maybe not so perfectly good) and nothing else 
happens. Well, time to go the other way!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0308.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><i>Lina: Have we?
<br>Serene: Where have you been?
<br>Lina: I've had my eyes closed.</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0309.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Why is it snowing underground? Because it's winter. Oh, of course!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0310.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>You come across a sweet lake. Ford, wade, ignore?
<br>
<br>We don't like getting wet, so we go back.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0311.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Okay, I didn't screenshot this room, but trust me when I say that 
was not there before. So we step in and end up in a giant crystal room 
which is apparently the Red Shrine.
<br>
<br>(I swear I screenshotted this.) A voice asks us to tell it the 
priest of fire. But since we can't just say it, we have to go back to 
all those graves to get the ankhs for each priest and figure out which 
one is which. (Or use savestates. Or a walkthrough.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0312.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>So putting an ankh at the Red Shrine messes with the water level. 
And even though I chose savestates, this line is pretty appropriate.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0313.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>So it is, Lina. So yeah, we screw around with the Red, Yellow and Blue Shrines to get through the lake.
<br>
<br>suddenly POISON
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0314.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Fia is the Simple Wikipedia of Riviera.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0315.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>What was that? We <i>are</i> falling for it this time? (Also it actually isn't trapped ha ha.)
<br>
<br>So WHO IS THIS FINAL ACCURSED?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0316.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Goddamn it. In that case, the final boss is Dracula.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0317.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Er, I mean, of course not. This is the final boss.
<br>
<br>But honestly, he's pretty easy. He pallete-swaps red shortly into the battle <s>for a one-on-one with Ein</s>, and after that, he doesn't seem to use any attacks besides his Break Out, which isn't all that powerful anyway.
<br>
<br>Awesome we killed Death and saved the universe.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%206_files/riviera0318.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Of course she did. But...
