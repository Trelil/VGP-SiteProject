<font size="5"><b>Let's Play Riviera: Chapter 5</b></font><br>

<br>Last time we entered the Colosso again. Apparently that caused the water level to stop rising, which is nice.
<br>

<br>Okay NOW we're in the colosseum. Which is an ARENA FOR BATTLE. Thanks for the info, Cierra.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0196.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Serene what are you doing being southern. So we can choose to pull one of these ropes. Let's pull all three!
<br>
<br>Left: KILLER BEES.
<br>Middle: Barrel falls on your head. Ow, my max HP.
<br>Right:
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0197.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Sprites really like hybrid fruits. And hey, with names like "Banango," I think I do too.
<br>
<br>After pulling any of these, a memo from either RED SAGE or BLUE FOOL
 falls that talks about what you got for pulling the rope. Also we get 
the rope we pulled because it's not nailed down.
<br>
<br>And on the next screen -
<br>
<br>Red: <i>The Red Sage!</i>
<br>Blue: <i>And the Blue Fool!</i>
<br>Red: <i>Are here!</i>
<br>Blue: <i>Heeere~</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0198.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>So anyway. Apparently these two caused the flood and are calling us 
cheaters for escaping it. Red is too cool for Fool and leaves him to 
fight us.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0199.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>That's my line.
<br>
<br><b>(At this point in the update, I got bored fighting Blue Fool and 
stopped here to finish it later. About a week after not finishing it, I 
made up for it with a <a href="http://vgperson.com/riviera/indexb.htm">bonus update.</a>)</b>
<br><a name="break">
<br>After a battle that absolutely did <b>not</b> take months, the Blue Fool fell.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0224.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>No, Blue Fool, you are the demons. (Seriously, you suck for delaying this LP for months.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0225.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh yeah, the flooding. That's nice of him. So he runs away and we keep climbing.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0226.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>There sure is. And when we see a barrel, we Barralax it.
<br>
<br>Or hammer, whatever.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0227.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Though really, Ein just seems to be punching it. We get some more Banangos.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0228.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Don't stop there! Destroy ALL of it!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0229.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Fia offers to uncurse this sword, but for some reason we also get the option to just take it without letting her do that. Uuuum.
<br>
<br>(Yeah, I tried, and it just makes you hurt yourself and get a weaker sword.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0230.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>It's harder to get appropriate screenshots than I remember. Anyway, we get to see if we are truly courageous. Fun.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0231.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>What? Rose, I <i>wasn't</i> thinking about that until you offered. (If you try, she just scratches you.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0232.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Yeah, we're courageous as hell.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0233.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><i>And</i> sexy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0234.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>No comment.
<br>
<br>Once out of the Colloseo, a sign falls from the sky.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0235.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Fia: <i>It's a very unique style of writing.</i>
<br>Serene: <i>In other words, it sucks.</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0236.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Wait, so it's not even in another language or anything? Dammit, Lina, you're not supposed to be giving me comparisons to Cirno.
<br>
<br>Pretty much the same thing happens here as with the ropes (get a Banango or get hurt), except the correct answer is obvious.
<br>
<br>In the next area, Fia gives us an explanation about how the ground is made of mithril or something.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0237.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Well, sure.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0238.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Well that can't be important. (Preceded by "people say the city began sinking.")
<br>
<br>Fia hears someone in a dark window, so we throw a rock in there. And out comes...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0239.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Insert Mr. Batty joke. Lina asks us to catch it...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0240.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>And Cierra is a disgusting jerk who thinks about eating it. What.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0241.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>My name is Ein, come on let's angel karaoke. I caught it and ended 
up tossing it because it's really not that useful, but hey, Lina likes 
watching me catch bats for her, so I'll do it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0242.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>For having the great idea of going backwards despite the rising water level, we find a mermaid.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0243.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I mean, Undine. Look, I can't be expected to keep track of these 
different names for the same species concept. So she wants to reward us 
for saving her sister which I don't remember at all.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0244.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>You can tell she's from an ancient race because she uses the word 
"jiffy." So she goes to discuss what to give us with the other girls.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0245.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Iria: <i>... ... ... ... *sweatdrop*</i>
<br>Aria: <i>*giggle* Not when a man's around.</i>
<br>
<br>Those dirty mermundines. Anyway they're slow so we go on while they're deciding what to give me.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0246.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>We get to shut down this Golem via Quick Time Event because we got 
that Golem Manual months ago. However, we still have to deal with the 
Sad Golem Operators.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0247.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>(No, really.)

<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0248.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>STOP IT LINA.
<br>
<br>We go back down to the water and get Iria's Bow after Iria gives us some embarrassed <s>animu</s> talk.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0249.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>We can't get to this green chest or another nearby green chest because we're suddenly in an N64 game or something.
<br>
<br>However, we eventually get around to one of them and get a Golden 
Key. We go all the way back to the golden door and it leads to to the 
other chest, containing...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0250.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I can't think of a good joke about choosing poorly.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0251.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>But at least Lina always has something worth screenshotting.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0252.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein knows the code. (Again.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0253.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>The... what? If we disable it, we get a note from Red Sage that calls us a cheater. Several screens later, we meet her.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0254.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Says the girl who is literally covered only by, uh, weird bandages.

<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0255.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This is a lot funnier if you imagine that Serene just went ZA WARUDO
 on Sage and Fool, but that's just what happens when you're challenged 
to fight. Now we fight Red Sage and
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>she's pretty easy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0256.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Sprites only eradicate other Sprites, and that's only if there are more than eight of them on the same scanline.
<br>
<br>We get a choice to kill them or not, but what the hell that's just 
mean. (What's meaner, though, is that we get 2000 extra points for 
"passing judgement." You're a jerk, game.)
<br>
<br>Finally, we're in the final area, which is some kind of cathedral.	
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0257.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Lina's just in au of how much gold there is here. (I'm a terrible person.)

<br>Exiled from Asgard, fallen angels, blah blah blah. No one cares.

<br>What. We QTE over to one of the statues for no good reason and climb up, then jump to...

<br>Oh then I guess we should carefully pick what page we -

<br>One of these days, Lina, I'm going to regret always listening to you. Maybe.

<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0263.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Serene aspires to be a stand-up comic, but Fia interrupts her with something boring.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0264.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Yeah well no one likes magic. We pull out some kind of memo stuck in this book Fia's talking about.

<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0265.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Whatever that means. Finally, we get out of here.

<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0266.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>THANK YOU.

<br>What is that even supposed to be?

<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%205_files/riviera0268.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh hey right we're supposed to be looking for Accursed. Guys. So one
 of those Archangels appears and it's like "you don't have wings either 
so you should totally join me" but we're like "naw."
<br>
<br>And we beat her up and nothing important happens BUT THEN ON THE WAY TO ELENDIA...

<br>Ein is revealed to be schizophrenic. Alternatively, Ledah is here.
<br>
<br>They have animu talk about how Ein has betrayed him and should come back to his side. Screw you, Ledah.

<br>And Ledah says screw you to making replies that make sense.
<br>
<br>After that, he just disappears. Well, that was pointless.
