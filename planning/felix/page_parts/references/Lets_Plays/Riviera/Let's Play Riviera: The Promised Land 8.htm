<br>I like Eins, but now, it's about risks.
<br>
<br>Anyway, everyone just says positive things about how they'll totally still be alive tomorrow. How positive of them.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0373.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh thanks I wasn't really sure.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0374.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>See what I mean? By using The Promised Land to fake people out for 
the last chapter, they pretty much blew their chance at a dramatic final
 chapter subtitle.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0375.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>And it turns out the Maze of Shadows is a palette swap of Chapter 1. Effort! Okay so not <i>all</i> of it is but it still seems pretty lazy to me.
<br>
<br>There are a bunch of chained rocks you can look at to somehow 
trigger conversations about how Ein realizes he was a moron the first 
time he came here.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0376.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0377.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0378.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>There, Fia being motivational. Is that good enough for you?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0379.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Now back to screenshotting just about every instance of this Lina 
portrait in the game. (So yeah, there are apparently earthquakes for 
some reason.)
<br>
<br>Then we get attacked by a BOMBER KID who uses an ATOMIC BOMB Break 
Out. Uh, what. After the battle, the ground shakes really badly and we 
fall.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0380.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Do we really not know what a bomb is? I swear there were Bomber Kids
 earlier, or maybe that's just because they look identical to all the 
other dwarf guy enemies.
<br>
<br>So anyway, we have to be careful not to activate his Break Out to proceed.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0381.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Yep.
<br>
<br>So after going up some stairs and winding paths, we actually get to 
the Maze of Shadows in... the fourth area? This chapter might be shorter
 than I remember.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0382.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Hi there.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0383.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0384.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>That's a pretty great answer. Oh and she gave up HER FUTURE to 
become a Grim Angel, whatever that means. Ultimately, it's just an 
excuse for her to be dumb and follow Hector. For which we shall beat her
 up.
<br>
<br>But after the battle, she runs away. Geez.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0385.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Now we're in this Ruby Tier place with creepy music.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0386.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>No, you're really not.
<br>
<br>We find some black feathers and realize that hey those black 
feathers in Yggdrasil might have been Malice's, not Ledah's. But I'm not
 sure how that's significant at all.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0387.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>What is this, a Megaman game?! Yeah, so we're pretty much refighting
 the Accursed in the Ruby, Emerald, and Sapphire Tiers, except now 
they're called Dark Progenitors. That word is completely made up.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0388.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0389.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0390.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Rose is gonna be pissed when she finds out cats can't write.
<br>
<br>So really, what the frick IS a Dark Progenitor?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0391.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Well, I didn't actually care, but thanks anyway Ein.
<br>
<br>After the Sapphire Tier, we loop back to the Ruby Tier and have to 
maze around to find the rest of the Dark Projerkators. And by maze 
around, I mean take random warps until you find all of them.
<br>
<br>Along the way, each of our party members gets all sentimental, but 
evidently the only one I cared about enough to show was Rose. Oh well.
<br>
<br>Soon after we defeat Dark Death...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0392.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>OH NO I DID NOT THINK THIS WOULD HAPPEN (also, please shake monitor)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0393.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Never heard that one before.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0394.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>The gods don't care about pixel people. And for that, we must battle.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0395.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Man, when was the last time I took a battle screenshot? Anyway, mystery HP is never a good sign.
<br>
<br>(Actually, it's more lazy coding than anything - it shows the real 
value once it goes below 10000. And his HP is only slightly more than 
that.)
<br>
<br>As for the battle, he pretty much just has a changing element 
gimmick, which is really annoying because it makes Lina's extremely 
broken Stardust attack not be effective most of the time.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0396.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>You've been extremely bad about that lately, yes.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0397.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh. Well, nuts. I thought I had a pretty good chance, but according to Malice, she already won. How'd I let that happen?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0398.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0399.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Uh. What?
<br>
<br><b>EXTREMELY GRAPHIC SCENE REMOVED</b>
<br>
<br>And Malice dies somehow.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0400.gif" width="480" height="320">

<br><b>INSERT SUMMONING HERE</b>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0402.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Maybe you shouldn't have killed Lina then, she was like my most powerful member. :C
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0403.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0404.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Also this guy is a jerk, who's surprised.
<br>

<br>So now it's time for the final battle with Ultima Jerk. Come on, crew, let's -
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0407.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>...:&lt;
<br>
<br>She's pretty much the same deal as Hector but with more HP, different music, and <i>less</i> annoying elemental forms. (And NOT LINA. And also I was running out of weapon uses.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0408.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>That's right. You fade out dramatically while screaming weirdly.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0409.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>And so on. Seth-Rah doesn't exactly admit we're cool before disappearing forever, but hey, what can you expect.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0410.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Not with that picture (and this crazy music), it's not. Yes, 
Seth-Rah was a load-bearing boss. Although, technically, I guess it was 
just Seth. But then we get warped out or something.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0411.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh right, you. Wait, did I actually make a promise or did I just say I'd save Riviera a lot?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0412.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%208_files/riviera0413.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>OH GOD GHOST LINA DON'T HAUNT ME
<br>
<br>(Yeah, Ursula just revived her and that's taken in the middle of her
 fading in from white. But can you even imagine what kind of antics 
Ghost Lina would entail?)
<br>
<br>So Ursula is kind of disappearing because Seth disappeared. Not sure how that works, but it kinda sucks.
<br>
