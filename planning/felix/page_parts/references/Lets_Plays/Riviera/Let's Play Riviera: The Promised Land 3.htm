<br>...Demons appeared and we defeated them. Again.

<br>Ein: <i>Gee, thanks.</i>
<br>

<br>Someone turned off the background layer. Fia turns it back on for a 
like a second with light magic which lets us see a torch. Except we 
don't have our torch anymore. Whoops!
<br>
<br>Of course, even if we hadn't put it out, that dragon would have blown it out, right? Logically.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0103.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>We dodge FOUR fireballs by means of increasingly difficult quick 
time events. But hey, 12000 points. And of course, Ein doesn't lose like
 20% of his max HP, which is always nice.
<br>

<br>There's some weird statue and some weird lithogram on the roof of 
the castle. But only people from Asgard can read it and no one -
<br>

<br>Oh god what. It summons an Accursed guy. No one can hurt him, and 
even though he says "you aren't going to use the Diviner?", Einherjar 
doesn't work. He Breaks the fish Out of us.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0108.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh, that's nice.
<br>
<br>This guy is actually kind of hard considering what we've fought so 
far, especially since his Break Out is apparently just as powerful as 
before. Einherjar now has a pretty strong, bar-breaking Over Skill, 
though, so that's cool.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0109.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Oh, that's... not very nice.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0110.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Shh, not so loud!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0111.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>This is a killing mission. It may require the use of Diviners. Obviously, the girls beg us not to, you know, destroy them.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0112.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>A heart-wrenching decision, but the choice is clear.
<br>
<br>Ein: <i>Sorry, but I can't...
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>...go on as a Grim Angel.</i>
<br>
<br>Ein is a master of dramatics.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0113.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Okay thanks. Who are you, again?
<br>
<br>We go back to Elendia. Time to talk to everyone again!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0114.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Hey, it's that bat. And no, not even town scenes can drive off quick
 time events. This one is a Bat Jr., though I don't yet know the 
difference.
<br>
<br>There's more bread in Fia's house. Sweet, etc.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0115.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>I knew those Moon Lilies would be a good idea. Meute gives us an... Ice Javelin? Okay, cool.
<br>
<br>There's an Applecot randomly lying on the ground. What on <i>earth</i> is an Applecot? Lina gets a skill by eating one twice, though, so I guess I should take it.
<br>
<br>The fox (?) girl who wanted to pick me up wants my Mosamo Ash. In return, I get a Flag. What does a Flag do?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0116.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Go team?
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0117.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Once we're done in town, we go to the elder's house where the girls 
are talking about going to fight Accursed... s. Of course Fia and Lina 
and Serene all want to help, so let's go already. To the Accursed!
<br>
<br><b>CHAPTER 3: THE ACCURSED</b>
<br>(hey i just said that)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0118.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Enough said.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0119.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Awww.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0120.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Uhhh.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0121.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Maybe I should feed my readers this so I don't actually have to make jokes!
<br>
<br>Okay, that was terrible.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0122.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0123.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Well, Lina knows better than any Mushroom Book. She cuts off a piece and -
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0124.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>WHOOPS. Fortunately nothing bad happened right guys.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0125.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein sinks trying to open this chest. After we get out (it, 
unfortunately, turns our sweet, free Bread into Wet Bread), we get 
someone else to go open the chest.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0126.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein figures Lina is light and Serene has wings. Fia is too fat, of 
course. I'm guessing both would have worked, but Serene gets the chest 
really easily.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0127.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Now Eindiana Jones has to spell his own name. But in the Sacred Tongue, Ein starts with... well, an E, probably.
<br>
<br>Serene skips the quick time event and just flies over.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0128.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>So lazy.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0129.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Refined? Pile of rubble? What is this crazy talk. Fia searches and 
finds THUNDER ONYX, which I guess makes nearby rocks arrange themselves 
more neatly.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0130.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>It's just so brown. You call that realism? Oh, and the fact that there have been like five rooms with this same background.
<br>
<br>We eventually get outside and when we can't open a door, we try to 
climb up a branch and end up falling when some birds surprise us. Ow.
<br>
<br>Serene: <i>Everyone's fine, then?</i>
<br>Lina: <i>I'm not fine!</i>
<br>Serene: <i>But, you're not hurt, right?</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0131.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Lina is a poet and she doesn't even know it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0132.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Hi, completely unimportant girl. She tries to use a spell to get us out.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0133.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>She's not very good at it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0134.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0135.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>She does have good aim, though.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0136.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>And Ein has no clue. I guess Witchy is pretty fat since the branch breaks. Double whoops.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0137.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>See, Lina was right in the end. And you doubted her.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0138.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>She's Cierra, and her friend is Gateau, who may have metal joints. 
On the way back to where we were, Cierra proves her usefulness...
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0139.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>...No, not really.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0140.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Some midget demons are picking on a midget demon with 
differently-colored hair. Those jerks. We help him and get some item I 
already forgot and probably tossed. Yeah, helping people out and all, 
but where are the <i>points?</i>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0141.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Wait, you mean those were homing pigeons? This time we climb up the branch without incident.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0142.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Well, as long as it's not lupus, we'll try to help it. However, Fia 
doesn't consider herself the doctor type, so we just leave it injured 
and it gives us a Happy Plume. Apparently the Harpie's name is Happy. 
Yep.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0143.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>A golden egg that I didn't have the TP to inspect before! We take it because hey, free egg.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0144.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>It turns out this is a birdemon's egg. Oh well. Humorously, they drop a 10-use Egg to add to the 5-use one we just stole.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0145.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Having eggs makes you a man, Serene. You wouldn't understand.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0146.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>How convenient. You're still not very useful, though.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0147.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Lina runs over to a jewel, everyone crowds around, and then you 
start shaking your monitor really hard. Foooools! We quick time event on
 out of there.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0148.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Ein has had food on the brain ever since he had to toss out his free bread. Also, it <i>is</i> an egg, Serene doesn't know what she's talking about. It's an inedible key item egg, but still.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0149.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Riviera:%20The%20Promised%20Land%203_files/riviera0150.gif" width="480" height="320">
<br>Social commentary! Yeah, that's a good enough ending point.
