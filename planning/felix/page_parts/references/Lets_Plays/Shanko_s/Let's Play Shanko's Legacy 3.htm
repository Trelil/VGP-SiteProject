Well, since I need to keep this topic alive to encourage Mitch to continue doing the game that led to this horrible monster <i>[ED: LPing Jumper]</i>, I went ahead and finished the LP. So much for interactivity!

<br>Chapter 3: The Dessert
<br>

<br>I am so totally ready to rock this dessert.
<br>

<br>B-birds?
<br>

<br>I forgot to take any screenshots (every time I tried I was shaking 
too hard to hit the right button), but I rid a bird to the end of this 
level. In an alternate universe, my utter fear may have been 
well-deserved! (I'll get on that later, hopefully.)

<br>Haha, <i>quicksand.</i> Dabomstew's greatest creation, any version of Mono Country be bl***ded.

<br>This shaft I just went through is amazing. If you're standing on the
 (VERTICAL HELL YEAH) moving platform when it hits the jump blocks, it 
bounces off. If you jump, it goes right through. Thanks for that, 
Dabomshank.

<br>These are SUPER JUMP BLOCKS. They're super!
<br>

<br>No, I didn't do anything wrong; you're really supposed to be able to
 do these four areas in any order. So yeah, according to Shanko, we went
 to the Vally and saw some cats. Awesome. (Also, there isn't actually a 
cat onscreen, so I cropped it.)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%203_files/shanko0060.gif">
<br>Aww, kitty.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%203_files/shanko0061.gif">
<br>KITTY IS DROPPING MINES
<br>

<br>After failing to beat robokitty by dropping ice blocks on it, I 
accidentally pressed Z and started shooting these. They head toward the 
nearest purple block (forgot to mention those; they become unsolid for a
 time when you hit the Ps and, when off, act similarly to off red/blue 
blocks in Clicker) and destroy them. If there are none left, they just 
fly to the upper-left.
<br>
<br>This has nothing to do with beating robokitty though, you <b>are</b> supposed to kill it with ice blocks. Shanko just has horrible collision detection, I guess.
<br>
<br>After that, I fortunately didn't get a cutscene about how the 
robokitty infused Shanko with the ultimate power when it died and went 
back to the overworld. Next time: swamp!
