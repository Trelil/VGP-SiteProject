<br>Kittens? I haven't seen those before!!!!

<br>I opened this door and this kitty WHICH I HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE ran
 at me. He's still running into that wall, but you can't see that.

<br>Valley 2 Walkthrough 5.1
<br>The Valley 2 is a tough level to beat if you are new to the jumper 
world. Be warned that it takes a big step from the other levels you have
 played. It is actually quite easy of you are skilled at Jumper.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%206_files/shanko0083.gif">
<br>First thing you will see upon entering the valley is some new green 
blocks never seen before, unless you disobeyed my psychically-issued 
command to do this sector first. If you are familiar to the Jumper 2 
engine this will be extremely simple. Just act as if you were wall 
jumping, and there you have it, the wall climb.

<br>You have finished the Valley 2, and make sure to be careful there are harder levels that await you.
<br>
<br>The fact that Shanko might have actually put a lot of effort into 
this stage, since he made a walkthrough for it, is truly terrifying. It 
may even imply that it's supposed to be a puzzle level, when the biggest
 puzzle (which I skipped) was dropping ice blocks onto fireballs - <i>through spikes!</i>

<br>The floor disappeared and Morphis fell after me. I think this is the only name mentioned in this game so far except Shanko.
<br>

<br>The level begins with you falling into a pile of rocks. Slowly. This level is very, very laggy and it is painful.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%206_files/shanko0088.gif">
<br>It's really boring and really slow, so I didn't take any other 
screens. Also, Morphis might as well not be there after you see him at 
the start; he moves toward you, but really slowly. This is basically the
 only other place you might see him, and it's the end.
<br>
<br>Naturally, when I walk off the right there, it just takes me to the 
overworld. Well, I'm sure Shanko will wrap up all of these loose-ended 
boss battles later.
<br>
<br>But now that path at the top of the overworld is open! What terrors await us for Shanko to jump into and kill instantly?
<br>
<br>Coming later today, the exciting and massive <font id="size1">17-image</font> conclusion.
