Chapter 7: I must be crazy, because I swear there was a bridge level 
here. With Battle on the Big Bridge, even! What's wrong with you, 
Shanko?!
<br>
<br>So I went through that tunnel and into a door.
<br>

<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0090.gif">
<br>Crate stacking!
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0091.gif">
<br>You may notice many of the fireballs disappeared. I think they sort of, uh... floated off screen.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0092.gif">
<br>...Yeah. I can see it now. Kaizo Shanko's Legacy. Bird riding in every stage, naturally.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0093.gif">
<br>Again, a bunch of fireballs just floated off screen.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0094.gif">
<br>Shanko was going to do voice acting here but the file was too big so
 he did this perfect transcription of what it sounded like. He even said
 "a-swell."
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0095.gif">
<br>Well, great, I'm fighting Ganon. I beat him, though. Also, my shards
 counter went up to 400 or so and was used for his health, and an 
incredibly loud beep was played when I hurt him! Could this have 
philosophical meaning? No.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0096.gif">
<br>THIS GUY MEANS BUSINESS. Hence the hardcore guitar music.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0097.gif">
<br>Man, that robot dude totally knocked me out of the way! Hardcore.
<br>
<br>So this boss is annoying. Unlike Morphis, he actually follows you 
quickly, and shoots fireballs constantly. Also, every few seconds, he 
does this.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0098.gif">
<br>The walls turn into fireballs, then <b>shoot</b> fireballs at you. Yep. Also, <b><i><u><s>DIE</s></u></i></b>
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0099.gif">
<br>But you can get him stuck here really, really easily. He's stupidly hard otherwise.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0100.gif">
<br>This is the 100th image, so you know this is important.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0101.gif">
<br>The final boss of Shanko's Legacy! Sorta. Those fireballs circle 
around, and other fireballs bounce around randomly, and there's these 
giant X things that come out of the core and destroy platforms. It's an 
endurance thing. I died pretty quickly.
<br>
<br>And kept dying.
<br>
<br>And according to Shanko, it's supposed to end eventually, but it's so incredibly annoying and long I never made it.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shankoskip.gif">
<br>Well, nuts to that.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0102.gif">
<br>I tried shooting this guy with Z-shots. It didn't work. The switch is facing the wrong way, so I can't turn it off or anything.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shankoskip.gif">
<br>I sure hope I'm not missing any plot by doing this.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0103.gif">
<br>Man, this level looks annoying. But I must beat it! I don't remember
 actually getting past the final boss guy before, so I'm semi-interested
 in -
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0104.gif">
<br>SHANKO WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0105.gif">
<br>PIRATEMOOOOO
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%207_files/shanko0106.gif">
<br>And so ends the demo levels of the worst Jumper fangame ever.
<br>
<br>Well, that was fun. Sort of. Maybe coming next: Ogmo Boss Fights! 
But that's about it because most Jumper fangames are just incredibly 
boring.
