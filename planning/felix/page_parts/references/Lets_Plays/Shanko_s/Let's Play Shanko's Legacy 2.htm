PS. I'm trying to crop as many screens as I can, but that isn't many, so
 sorry for all the huge images. I'd transcribe some of the text, but the
 many ways in which Shanko presents it are too good to pass up.
<br>
<br>PPS. Why am I putting postscripts before the update?

<br>Chapter 2: Some Lab
<br>
<br>Last time on Shanko's Legacy we stopped at a level. Let's go beat that level.
<br>

<br>No way.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%202_files/shanko0036.gif">
<br>Well, what do you know.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%202_files/shanko0037.gif">
<br>This level is annoying.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%202_files/shanko0038.gif">
<br>But then I beat it so I wasn't that annoyed anymore.
<br>

<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%202_files/shanko0040.gif">
<br>No, I'm not saving these screens as JPEGs.

<br>This guy shoots fireballs. That means he's dangerous.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%202_files/shanko0042.gif">
<br>Well, I got to him. But how do you hurt him? Well, I jumped into him, then he, uh, shrank and died. Yeah.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%202_files/shanko0043.gif">
<br>We're in some sort of new level with Sonic music or something? I dunno. Most of the levels have Sonic music.
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%202_files/shanko0044.gif">
<br>WAIT WHY CAN'T I STOP MOVING AAAAAAAAA
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%202_files/shanko0045.gif">
<br>NOT THE PIT IT BURNS

<br>That's one big overworld. Don't worry, I'm never taking a screenshot of this again. (Also, VERTICAL PLATFORMS YEAH)
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%202_files/shanko0052.gif">
<br>Oh yeah, I collected all those crystal things and this is all I have
 to show for it. As far as I know, this never affects anything for the 
rest of the game. You're the best, Shanko.
<br>
<br>So where do we go, guys? The MS Paint-colors Swamp? The valley of Vally? The tasty Dessert? Or the Impact-font ICE?
<br>
<br>(Oh yeah, and the circle isn't a level, it just saves your game. Sorry guys, Shanko never explores a giant circle. I think.)
