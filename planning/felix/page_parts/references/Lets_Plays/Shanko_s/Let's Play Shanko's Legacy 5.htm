<br>This is unbelievably fitting. Did I mention that those fireballs are
 moving in circles (like the ones in the CAN'T STOP THE SHANKO level) 
around that text and SMB underwater music is playing?

<br>This level is a stroke of genius from Shanko. You have to step on 
the pressure switch to let out the moving platform (which is turning on 
and off because of the cannons), then drop two falling blocks onto it 
when it passes under so they cover the top two spikes and you can push 
the crate on them. This would be great if, when you stood on the top 
blue block, you didn't die.
<br>
<br>Instead of a fairly clever use of a glitch, you're supposed to - I <b>think</b>
 - trap the platform between those two far left stacks of falling blocks
 and deal with pushing on a buggy moving platform to get the crate on 
the switch.

<br>Every ten out of ten times, this will happen. I'm almost certain this is the way it's supposed to be done.

<br>I finally got this to happen. But still, it's obviously not the intended way.

<br>This boss just jumps and shoots the Scratch animation from Pokemon 
Virus at you. I can't even remember who made the skin for him or what 
its name was. But no one cares because you just get the fireball gem 
thing, stand under him, and mash Control.

<br>That was actually really short, I should have posted them together in the first place. Oh well, last two updates tomorrow.
