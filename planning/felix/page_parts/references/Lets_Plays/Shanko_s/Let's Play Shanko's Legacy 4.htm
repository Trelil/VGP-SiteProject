Chapter 4: The Swamp

<br>Shanko sure loves elaborating on things for the benefit of everyone that's playing for the plot.

<br>For once, Shanko is not lying. When you touch water, the game runs at 15 FPS. Intentionally.

<br>I'm going to assume that green thing on the floor is an alligator, by the way.

<br>I accidentally overwrote two screens of me underwater (which made up
 basically the entirety of level 1, whoops!), so I took this one 
instead. Bubbles!

<br>The embodiment of evil (or something) is terrified of a blob of MS 
Paint colors that's - somehow - "looking right at him." Who wouldn't be.

<br>THE TENTACLE
<br>
<br><img src="Let%27s%20Play%20Shanko%27s%20Legacy%204_files/shanko0070.gif">
<br>This is wonderful.

<br>I tried to get to the core thing because that's what I remember 
having to do, but I just died, so I tried waiting a long time without 
dying. After failing to dodge the lightning shots (they're pretty fast),
 I jumped up into the corner (where you can see some Z-shots; I really 
don't know why they exist but you actually seem to have them all the 
time) and managed to get stuck here. The lightning couldn't reach me, 
but I was wrong about the waiting.
<br>
<br>Then I tried one more time to touch the blob in the center and bam, overworld map.
<br>
<br>These bosses are <i>thrilling.</i>
