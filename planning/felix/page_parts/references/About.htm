<font id="comment">Incredibly inaccurate artist's depiction. Except for the curls.</font><br><br>

I'm vgperson, but you may call me vghime, Princess of the Vocaloid 
Kingdom. The v is lowercase. And the g. And the... you get the idea.<br>
I translate things, if you haven't noticed. I also do computery stuff 
and play video games. (Could one of these be related to my name? A 
mystery for the ages...)<br><br>

My <a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> has a bunch of translations and other things not on my website.<br>
My <a href="http://www.youtube.com/vgperson">YouTube channel</a> is mostly for subtitled songs.<br>
My <a href="http://soundcloud.com/vgpersona">SoundCloud</a> (<a href="http://soundcloud.com/vgperson">old account</a>) has a bunch of songs I made in PXtone.<br><br>

If you want to ask me something, you can ask me on Tumblr if you have one, or email vghimmel at gmail.<br>
Any other method of contact is playing a dangerous game (of probably never getting a reply).<br><br>

Please don't send me requests for song translations. If I want to do a song, I'll come across it myself.<br>
I also try to regularly look for games to translate and have passed on a
 lot of candidates, so I generally won't accept requests for those 
either.<br>
However, if you find a particularly good game which you think I've overlooked, you can try suggesting it.<br><br>

And last but not least: I am a boss<a href="http://vgperson.com/">!</a><br><br>
