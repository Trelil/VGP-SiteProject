<font id="size5"><b>Future Game Plans</b></font><br><br>

The way I translate games, I don't have a "current project" the majority
 of the time - when I find a project I want to do, I'll just do it as 
quickly as possible.<br>
The most information I can give about my future projects is telling you 
what the creators of the games I've done already are up to, as they're a
 likely source of new games I'll want to translate.<br>
If an author isn't included here, it's probably because I either have no
 idea what they're up to, or have no plans to do more of their games in 
the future.<br><br>

<b>Ib:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><br>
kouri has wanted to do a new project for some time, but it's unclear what it will be; it may not even be a game.<br>
It is highly unlikely it will be a sequel to Ib, and he doesn't seem to want to make another horror game.

Fummy doesn't have a blog or anything beyond the TWH site, and I've seen nothing indicating plans for more games.

<b>Misao:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><b>Mad Father:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><br>
Sen might be working on a non-horror game, but almost nothing is known about it.<br>
His Mad Father FAQ explicitly says there will be no direct sequel, though there is the possibility of a game in the same series.<br>
Lastly, he has announced that there will be a Misao novel and a Mad 
Father novel coming out at roughly the same time, but no further 
details. I'll wait for more information before I say anything else.

<s>Insanity:</s> Not translating, as it's not a very good game, and Uri agrees. <a href="http://vgperson.tumblr.com/post/47984109507/insanity-by-uri">Summary here.</a><br><b>Paranoiac:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><b>The Crooked Man:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><b>Mermaid Swamp:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><b>The Sandman:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><br>
Uri is hard at work on several games. The current release schedule is: The Boogie Man, Sudden Illness, Pedestal.<br>
Other possible future titles (which were once on her site but are now in
 unknown status - for all I know, they became other games) are Haname 
and One Case.<br>
Lastly, there is a fourth game planned for the Strange Men Series (and 
there could be more if Uri has ideas), but even I know nothing at all 
about it.

<s>HeadLess:</s> Not translating, as I find it kind of... dumb.

tachi will probably be updating Hero &amp; Daughter for... a while.<br>
It's currently unknown what his next project will be.

Miwashiba is currently working on 1bitHeart, which so far has mostly 
just had random screenshots and not much info. It is still a Wolf RPG 
game, but has a side perspective.<br>
The LiEat series is complete. Alice mare will not have a sequel, as the 
true ending is, according to her, "the best happy ending in that world."

<div id="quote">
<b>Mogeko Castle:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><b>The Gray Garden:</b>
 Idly remarked that (since the original art asserts were 
double-resolution) they might like to remake it in RPG Maker VX, but 
that it might be fine as it is.<br><b>Wadanohara and the Great Blue Sea:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><br>
Mogeko has "announced" at least three future games via the bonus rooms, 
and it's unclear what order they'll come in. They are Carnival Rhythm, 
The End of Wonderland, and Mogeko Castle Gaiden.<br>
In addition, they want to make a prequel to The Gray Garden in the 
not-too-distant future, then a sequel to complete the trilogy.<br>
Note that Ice Scream is a manga/interactive thing and Poison Bugs is a 
video series, so it's unlikely there would be games for them.

<div id="quote">
<b>Touhou Mother:</b> No apparent update plans.<br><br>
S-tele is still working on Return of Touhou Mother, but he finds it very
 difficult to write for its relatively serious plot, and thus progress 
is very slow. On Video 29, he said he wanted to wrap it up in 2014.<br>
(Date of last video (29): May 12th, 2014. Date of last screenshot on Twitter: May 10th, 2014.)<br>
In the meantime, he's been making other weird RPG Maker games. (I'm not likely to translate any of those.)
