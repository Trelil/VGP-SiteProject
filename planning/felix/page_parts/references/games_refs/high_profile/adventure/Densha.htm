<b>Walkthroughs</b><br><br>

First, a direct walkthrough taking you through the whole game.<br>
<br>
<a href="javascript:%20toggleWalk1()">Walkthrough</a><br>
<div id="walk1" style="display: none">
<br>
<table id="youtwit" width="600px">
<tbody><tr><td>
Car 6: Go left to Car 12.<br><br>

Car 12: Walk to the left, and the man will turn the plate to warp you to Car 21.<br><br>

Car 21: Walk into the top half and go left to talk to the man from 
across the barrier for a dining ticket. Walk to the left on the bottom 
half to have him warp you back to 12.<br><br>

Car 12: Walk into the top and, go left, and talk to the man to give him 
the ticket. Pick up the stepladder and carry it to Car 6.<br><br>

Car 6: Place and climb the stepladder to get the pearl on the dresser. 
Place it in front of the plate on the wall and turn it twice to reach 
Car 9.<br><br>

Car 9: Get the mosquito coil. Go right to Car 4.<br><br>

Car 4: Place the mosquito coil and leave. Re-enter and get the [Ki] plate which drops out. Go right twice to Car 0.<br><br>

Car 0: Open the curtains to the right. Flip the "TV" switch by the man 
off. Return to the stepladder and turn the plate to go to the Inbetween 
(gray actual-train area with numbers out the window).<br><br>

Inbetween: Talk to the mononoke man for a watermelon. Flip the plate to go to White Space.<br><br>

White Space: Talk to the mononoke man to begin watermelon splitting. The
 man directs you away with "?" directions, and the woman directs you the
 right way with "!" directions. You get the silver cross key from the 
split watermelon. Flip the plate and turn it to return. Walk all the way
 left to Car 21.<br><br>

Car 21: Talk to the chef for a pot and ladle. Walk all the way right to Car 6. (Turn the plate twice if it's Car 9.)<br><br>

Car 6: Scoop the butter into the pot. Walk back to Car 21.<br><br>

Car 21: Give the chef the butter. Walk right to Car 3.<br><br>

Car 3: Use the nata to cut the grass on the left as well as the red flowers. Go to Car 6.<br><br>

Car 6: Remove the plate. Place the [Ki] plate and turn it until you go to a room of trees.<br><br>

Tree: Use the nata to cut the yellow flowers. Remove the [Ki] plate and 
put the other plate back. Carry the stepladder to Car 21.<br><br>

Car 21: Climb the stepladder and flip the plate to make it 51. Turn it twice to go to Car 15.<br><br>

Car 15: Use the ladle to scoop out the screw. Turn the plate twice to go to Car 51.<br><br>

Car 51: Carry the stepladder over to the clock and use the screw. Go left twice to Car 62.<br><br>

Car 62: Place the yellow flowers in the vase. Check the cupboard 
underneath for a plate half. Carry the stepladder to Car 62 and turn it 
to 26.<br><br>

Car 26: Place the red flowers in the vase. Check the cupboard underneath
 for a plate half, making the [37] Plate. Turn back to 62 and carry the 
stepladder right to Car 52. Turn it to 25.<br><br>

Car 52: Check the necklace and add the missing pearl to take it. Turn to 25.<br><br>

Car 25: Place the necklace on the table for the gold cross key. Remove the plate and place the [37] plate.<br><br>

Car 37: Step into the middle for a scene. (You can now pass through Car 37 freely.) Go to Car 10.<br><br>

Car 10: Open the door with the cross keys. Get the [10] plate. Carry the stepladder to Car 3.<br><br>

Car 3: Remove the [3] plate. Place whatever extra plate so that you have [Ki], [3], and [10]. Walk all the way left to Car 71.<br><br>

Car 71: Place the plates to spell "sa-yo-na-ra." Consult "sayonara.png" 
in the folder for how it should look. When a plate is correct, it 
"projects' to the sign in the background instead of being blank.<br><br>

Exact solution from left to right: 1. Place [Ki]. 2. Place [3]. 3. Place [10]. 4. Flip then turn the fixed [71] plate.
