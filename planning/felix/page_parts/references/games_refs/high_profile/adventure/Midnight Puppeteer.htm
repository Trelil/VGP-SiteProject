<b>Midnight Puppeteer</b> is a puzzle-solving exploration game by <a href="http://mayonin.husuma.com/">Mascarpone</a> made in Wolf RPG Editor.<br><br>

<i>Mayo and her teddy bear Mister Masper are being driven home one night by their father, when suddenly the car's engine stops.<br>
The father heads down a nearby path to find help, and when he doesn't return, Mayo and Masper decide to follow.<br>
There, they find a large mansion. And in the search for Mayo's father, they find much more...</i><br><br>

The latter half of the game has quite a few lengthy cutscenes.<br>
Mascarpone recommends not playing if you don't want to deal with that.<br>

<a href="javascript:%20toggleWalk()">Walkthrough</a><br>
<div id="walkthrough" style="display: none">
<br>
<table id="youtwit" width="600px">
<tbody><tr><td>
<b>Floor 1</b><br><br>

Follow the path and enter the mansion. Enter the first door on the left and get the Bat.<br><br>

Enter the second door on the right and use the Bat on the sofa (equip it and check the sofa) to get the 1F East Room key.<br><br>

Open the far-right door with the key.<br><br>

Hint:<br>
<span class="hint">Turning off the lights with the far-left lamp makes it extra dark. Could this be helpful somehow?</span><br><br>

Answer:<br>
<span class="hint">Having the darker lighting reveals a hidden code on 
the car painting. Go in the first door on the right and enter it into 
the safe: 1008</span><br><br>

Use the Rec Room key to open it (either of the two leftmost doors). Take the screwdriver from the bookshelf.<br><br>

Go to the far right in the entrance hall and use the screwdriver to open the vent. Crawl through and pull the lever.<br><br>

Back in the entrance hall, take the elevator to 2F.<br><br><br>


<b>Floor 2</b><br><br>

Use the screwdriver on the vent over on the right and check it for the 2F West Room key.<br><br>

Unlock the big room on the left side with the key. Check everything in the room. <span class="hint">Check under the desk one to the right of the top-left desk for a key.</span><br><br>

Unlock the far-right door with the Reference Room key. Check the right 
wall, and you'll find it sounds hollow; destroy it with the Bat. Enter 
the back room and pull the lever.<br><br>

Back in the main hall, take the elevator to 3F.<br><br><br>


<b>Floor 3</b><br><br>

Enter the room on the top-left. Proceed through the vent, and get the watering can and the 3F East Room key inside it.<br><br>

Go down to 1F and leave the mansion. Fill the watering can at the 
puddle. (If you didn't use the key yet, you'll lose it here, which locks
 you out of getting a hint for the following puzzle.)<br><br>

<span class="hint">Water the vases with wilted plants on each floor. 
1F's is in the Rec Room on the left, 2F's is in the west room, and 3F's 
is in the room where you got the watering can. This unlocks the security
 room, the bottom-right door on 3F.</span><br><br>

Pull the lever in the security room, then take the elevator to B1F.<br><br><br>


<b>Basement</b><br><br>

Pick up the photo on the ground. Go right and read the story on the wall in the far-right room to get the B1F West Room key.<br><br>

Unlock the west room with the key. Go to the lower-left section and read
 the diary, then follow the instructions. If you mess up, read the diary
 again to restart.<br><br>

After reading the diary, go right twice (no watering necessary) to see 
the shadow. Head to the top-right to see it again. Go left to the 
billiards table, then down to the carpet to see it again. Go left, 
through the cell door, and to the upper-left. Check the note for a hint.<br><br>

Hint:<br>
<span class="hint">Once you have the "slow to fast" hint, remember where you might have seen four clocks in a row.</span><br><br>

Hint 2:<br>
<span class="hint">The top-right room on 3F has four clocks showing 
different times. Putting the times together gets you five digits - now 
in what order do you arrange them?</span><br><br>

Answer:<br>
<span class="hint">The code for the panel in the red carpet room is 91087.</span><br><br>

After putting in the code, get the glass plate from behind the TV. Head 
right to the Pink Panda painting and put the plate on. Go right and 
enter the now-open door.<br><br><br>


<b>Dungeon &amp; Watchtower</b><br><br>

Head to the bottom-left of the dungeon area and go up the stairs.<br><br>

Go through the maze of red balls for a key. Check the message near the entrance to reset it.<br><br>

Maze Directions:<br>
<span class="hint">Push ball up. Push next ball up. Push next ball left 
twice, go down. Push next ball right. Push next ball left twice. Push 
ball above you up. Approach the lower ball (in the middle of the 
four-way intersection) from the top and push it down. Lastly, go to the 
ball on the left edge and push it into the pit.</span><br><br>

Open the door in the top-right of the courtyard with the key. Open the box for a shovel.<br><br>

Hint:<br>
<span class="hint">There are two equations on the floor of the dungeon 
and storehouse: 12 * 3 - 6 = ?, and 2 x 2 x 2 = !. Then there's another 
hint that connects them.</span><br><br>

Answer:<br>
<span class="hint">The code for the panel near the dungeon stairs is 240. After unlocking the cells, the top-right cell has a hint.</span><br><br>

Answer Part 2:<br>
<span class="hint">Use the shovel to dig into the left eye of the skull pattern in the dungeon. Remember, the skull's left eye, so it's your right.</span><br><br>

Use the Connecting Passage key to open the door in the storehouse. Open the vent with the screwdriver.<br><br>

Shove the statue toward the wall, then approach the clock on the right 
and it'll fall off the wall. Take the veranda key from the back of it.<br><br>

Open the door on the top floor of the tower with the veranda key. Get the hammer.<br><br>

Return to the connecting passage and break the cracked wall with the hammer. Go through and get the chocolate.<br><br>

Go back to the veranda and put the chocolate on the bird feeder. You can
 then safely cross the rope outside the second floor of the tower.<br><br>

<span class="hint">In the suspended ceiling room, the safe and the 
visible door are pointless. With the top-down diagram, you can tell 
there's another door - stand in front of the second pillar, face "down,"
 and check for a door there.</span><br><br><br>


<b>Mansion Annex</b><br><br>

Head for the big main room and enter the auditorium through the center 
door on the bottom floor. Go through the maze for the Annex 1F East Room
 key.<br><br>

Maze Directions:<br>
<span class="hint">Push ball up. Push next ball right twice. Push ball 
above you up. Go left and push next ball up. Push next ball down. Push 
the ball above you up. Push the ball to the right up. Head right and 
push the ball right three times. Go down and push the ball on the right 
to the right.</span><br><br>

Open the bottom-right door with the key. Go to the right side of the 
room and have Masper get the Annex 1F West Room key from on top of the 
closet.<br><br>

<span class="hint">In order to light the candles from right to left, 
re-enter the room and use the secret door in the wall, above the green 
chair. Then walk past the candles. This opens the closet, where you can 
change clothes. This is totally optional, though.</span><br><br>

Open the bottom-left door with the key. Open the box on the left for the Annex 3F West Room key.<br><br>

Open the top-left door with the key. Check the crane game controls. Talk
 to Masper through the glass, then check behind the top-right pillar for
 an extension cord.<br><br>

Go to the bottom-left room, use the extension cord to connect the 
machine to the plug, and play the game. Get all three questions right 
for the Annex 2F West Room key.<br><br>

Game Answers:<br>
<span class="hint">There are seven sets of questions. It starts with the first, and advances to the next each time you play.<br>
1. Carrot, Snowman, Croquet mallet<br>
2. Snowman (red gloves), Yamamba, Stuffed bear<br>
3. Carrot, Chocolate ice cream, Stuffed bear<br>
4. Croquet mallet (14 points), Snowman (smiling), Strawberry ice cream<br>
5. Strawberry ice cream, Bear, Choc<b>olate</b> ice <b>cream</b><br>
6. Snowman (blue bucket), Yamamba, Stuffed bear<br>
7. Snowman (Teddy bear (Yamamba)), Strawberry ice cream, Chocolate ice cream</span><br><br>

Open the middle-left door with the key. Equip the Hammer or Bat to break
 the pots, and threaten the pig on top of the shelves with it for a 
100-yen coin.<br><br>

Return to the top-left crane game room. Put the 100-yen coin in the slot. After the scene, check the crane controls again.<br><br>

Go into the middle-left room to look for Masper, then leave. Follow the person you see and enter the now-open top-middle door.<br><br>

(Cutscene Break)<br><br>

As Sohta, leave the room and check the right wall for a secret passage. 
Go into the bottom-middle door and talk to Kamikura next to the piano. 
Eventually, you have to say you trust him.<br><br>

Go to the top-middle room and take the ladder, then proceed out into the forest.<br><br><br>


<b>Forest</b><br><br>

When you come to a hole, bridge it with the ladder. (If you use the 
branch, it'll just break, so replace it with the ladder if you do that.)<br><br>

Proceed until you reach a maze-like area. Read the note on the wall for 
directions. If you wander long enough, Mothbee will appear to give you 
another hint.<br><br>

Hint:<br>
<span class="hint">The key is in identifying which "four-way crossroads"
 is being referred to. These are clearly marked by the brown patches in 
the center of each.</span><br><br>

Answer:<br>
<span class="hint">The correct intersection isn't in the small maze area
 on the left, but the large area on the right. Following the directions 
from there takes you to the previous screen, where checking the left 
wall gets you a rope. Use it to go down the well in the maze area.</span><br><br>

Proceed through the forest areas until you reach a locked door. Head back and take a right at the earlier intersection.<br><br>

Answer:<br>
<span class="hint">Step on the brown patches to summon crows at the two 
positions matching 2:45 on a clock: the patch two spaces clockwise from 
the top patch (2 o' clock), and the far left patch (9 o' clock). Take 
the key and use it on the door.</span><br><br>

(Cutscene Break)<br><br>

Take the right path and chase down the boy. (What you say to him doesn't
 have any real impact.) Afterward, proceed through the forest.<br><br><br>


<b>Mrs. Kishikawa's House</b><br><br>

<span class="hint">If you push a pedestal from the right room on the 
second floor out into the hall, over to the top-left corner, and climb 
up on it to reach the cardboard box, you can change into more outfits. 
Again, this is totally optional.</span><br><br>

Go upstairs. Enter the right room and push the pedestals around to reach
 the Nursery key. Open the left room with the key and search for hints. 
Go downstairs and open the safe with the code: <span class="hint">0709</span><br><br>

(Cutscene Break)<br><br>

Use the drawer key to open the desk drawer in the nursery.<br><br>

(Cutscene Break)<br><br><br>


<b>Forest</b><br><br>

Proceed to Keito's grandma's house.<br><br>

(Cutscene Break)<br><br>

Sneak past the youth club members, waiting for the right timing so they won't see you.<br><br>

General route to take:<br>
<span class="hint">Go to the bottom-right corner when the boy isn't 
looking. Walk through the part of the lower-left field that doesn't have
 plants (so it doesn't make a sound). Once you get above him, enter the 
house and enter the well.<br>
Just observe the pattern of the three guards going around in circles to find a good path through.<br>
With the girl traveling a vertical corridor, hide in the side areas and 
remember that she looks up at each intersection. Make sure you go to the
 left for the last one, because she'll check the right.<br>
For the final part, following behind the guards is probably the safest 
way to avoid being seen. The guard looking up and left repeatedly makes 
it impossible to take the low route, so go around the top.</span><br><br>

(Cutscene Break)<br><br>

You should figure out the chase for yourself, but if you want to ruin the fun:<br>
<span class="hint">Up, down, middle, middle, either, down.</span><br><br>

(Also, if you fail the chase five times, Mothbee will warp you to the end.)<br><br>

(Cutscene Break)<br><br><br>


<b>Mobiac Farm</b><br><br>

Check the closed gate on the left, then check the map that appears on 
the ground. Enter the building from the load entrance hidden behind the 
truck.<br><br>

Go to the second floor and into the top-right door for several hints on what to do.<br><br>

<span class="hint">First of all, go to the bathrooms on the right side 
of the second floor. Enter both bathrooms and flip all the stall toilet 
seats up. This puts a box of outfits in the bathroom hall.</span><br><br>

<span class="hint">To enter certain rooms, you must be wearing an outfit
 with the appropriate color: clerks wear black (maid uniform), workers 
wear beige (school uniform), and cooks wear white (white nurse gown or 
ballerina).</span><br><br>

The office has a terminal to release the electronic locks, but it won't 
work until an error in the cultivation room with the capsules is 
resolved.<br><br>

Answer:<br>
<span class="hint">Put on the yukata and pour the water from the free 
water balloon into the funnel in the capsule room. Then put on the maid 
uniform so you can go to the office (behind the front desk) to open the 
locks.</span><br><br>

Switch to the school uniform and enter the boiler room (leftmost door on
 the first floor). Get the Mobiac bait in the corner, then get the 
boiler turned on.<br><br>

Hint:<br>
<span class="hint">A diagram in the capsule room shows the pipe layout. 
Figure out which parts of the pipe should be open to connect the two 
sides, and turn the handles to light the lamps on those parts.</span><br><br>

Answer:<br>
<span class="hint">From left to right, light the top (only) lamp, the top lamp, and the bottom-most lamp. Then press the button on the touch panel.</span><br><br>

Go to the far-left room on the second floor.<br><br>

(Cutscene Break)<br><br>

Check the machine at the top of the room to open the lid on the container to the left. Look inside to get a ton of items.<br><br>

Talk to the girl in the bottom-center (the one who's talking with a boy)
 until she asks for something to write with. Give her the Notepad and 
Ballpoint Pen. She'll give you a wrench.<br><br>

Give the Wrench to the boy by the left wall, and get Mobiac bait from him. Use the bait on the swarm of Mobiacs on the right.<br><br>

Use the screwdriver to open the vent in the top-left, behind where the 
Mobiacs moved to. Crawl through the shafts and press the switch, then 
leave.<br><br>

(Cutscene Break)<br><br>

For the final chase, try to pull ahead next to the truck; once you get 
far enough ahead without being knocked back, you'll have succeeded. The 
truck will leave itself more "open" the less hearts you have, so it may 
help to get hit on purpose.<br><br><br>


<b>Bad Endings</b><br><br>

Bad End 1:<br>
<span class="hint">When you first gain control of Sohta in the mansion, 
rather than finding the secret door to reach the main part of the annex,
 take the obvious passageway (one of the boxes in the maze has a unique 
appearance and can be pushed) to return to the entrance. Leave the 
mansion and go back to the car.</span><br><br>

Bad End 2:<br>
<span class="hint">During the chase scene with Miren and Shun on the 
path to the Mobiac Farm, at the part with the destroyed sign where the 
paths merge, take the top path, then turn around and go backwards using 
the bottom path. (You'll just get caught if you do it the other way 
around.)</span>
