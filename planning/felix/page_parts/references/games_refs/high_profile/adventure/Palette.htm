<font id="size5"><b>Palette</b></font><br><br>

<b>Palette</b> is a freeware adventure game by <a href="http://www.enterbrain.co.jp/gamecon/no4/01.html">Yoshitaka Nishida (Finger Puppet)</a> made in RPG Maker 95.<br><br>

Palette was created in 2000 and won the grand prize in a competition held by the creators of RPG Maker.<br>
It later had a Japanese re-release on the Playstation by Enterbrain called "Forget Me Not -Palette-".<br>
(This translation is for the freeware original; I have no plans for the latter.)<br><br>

<i>One night, the psychiatrist Sianos B. Sian is requested to counsel a girl called B.D.,<br>
who has lost her eyesight and memory in an accident.<br>
Through conversations with her over the phone,<br>
the past that hides in her memories comes to light...</i><br><br>

(About compatability: Though the game is old, modern systems generally seem able to run it.<br>
However, it's likely the colors won't look right. The screenshots show how it should look.<br>
All I can say for sure is that emulating Windows 98 and running in full screen will give proper results.)<br>

<b>Walkthrough</b><br><br>

This describes the steps necessary to gain access to each Shred of Memory.<br>
You can do the requirements to reach them in slightly different orders, 
but the Shreds are always obtained in the same - or at least a very 
similar - order.<br>
Thus, if you're stuck, check which Shreds of Memory you already have and do the steps for the next one on the list.<br>

<b>Ordered Scenes</b><br><br>

The scenes are encountered in a fairly random order, which can make the plot harder to follow than it would be normally.<br>

<i>[Implied: Some combination of Vector, the Aging Man, Red Silhouette, and Macilt come up with the idea of Zebub.<br>
They invite people who are likely to become criminals to live there and 
use Lassa tobacco to make them lose their memories, theoretically 
avoiding the "inherited sin."]</i><br><br>

<b>Scene 12: Left Behind</b><br>
[Area: Present on table.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 13: Straw Hat</b><br>
B.D. comes home to a note and a (final) present from her father: a straw

present early.<br><br>

<b>Scene 14: Night, Lonely Night</b><br>
[Area: TV.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 15: News</b><br>
B.D. watches the news on TV. It reports that Canary Krim has woken up

<b>Scene 16: Early Morning Gate</b><br>
[Area: Outside a house, presumably B.D.'s.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 17: Light and Crowds</b><br>

<b>Scene 25: One Summer Afternoon</b><br>
[Area: Graveyard.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 26: Macilt Krim's Grave</b><br>
B.D. goes to the graveyard to pay respect to the Krims. Red Silhouette tells her she did nothing wrong.<br><br>

<b>Scene 27: Setting Sun</b><br>
[Area: Sunset.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 28: Red Silhouette</b><br>

Red Silhouette tells B.D. that she has to stay in Zebub as part of the

She says that even if B.D. loses her memory, she must at least remember that she is...<br><br>

<b>Scene 32: Night Wind</b><br>
[Area: Moonlit night.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 33: The Unchanging</b><br>
Red Silhouette tells B.D. a story from her home village about how the moon wants to be the sun or the stars rather than itself.<br>
She used to think that the moon could never change as the story said, 
but she now believes that maybe the moon could "be the sun, or be a 
star."<br><br>

<b>Scene 34: Room With A Lamp</b><br>
[Area: Room with a lamp.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 35: Lies and Deceit</b><br>
B.D. reads Red Silhouette's diary (which seems to discuss plans related 
to Zebub), and she comes in and scolds her. Lassa tobacco logs are also

<b>Scene 36: Candle Light</b><br>
[Area: Dining table with candles.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 37: Two of Us - B</b><br>

think that's the reason.<br><br>

<b>Scene 38: Little Longing</b><br>
[Area: Closet.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 39: Into the Closet</b><br>

but B.D. recognizes she's like a puppet, doing everything she says.<br><br>

<b>Scene 40: N/A</b><br>
[Area: Desert with a spring. Not actually accessible.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 41: Flower in the Desert</b><br>
[B.D. finds an old man in the desert, watering strange trees as part of the job he got at Zebub.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 42: Archives</b><br>
[Area: Library shelves.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 43: Sealed Room</b><br>
B.D. goes to a room in the library to read about things without someone (Red Silhouette) finding out.<br>
There's a report on the Krim family's criminal history, presumably part 
of the studies done for The Inherited Sin. (B.D. had seemingly forgotten
 where she heard the name Krim.)<br>
Another report realizes, after the publication of The Inherited Sin, 
that Vector himself was subject to a heinous crime, and that his own 
book doomed him in a way.<br>
Lastly, B.D. reads something concerning the hypothesis of The Inherited 
Sin. It calls children exposed to crime B.D.s ("born of disorder"), and 
says they must be focused rather than the criminals themselves.<br><br>

<b>Scene 44: The Essentials</b><br>
[Area: Fireplace and radio.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 45: Those Freed</b><br>
B.D. hears about a murderer who escaped from prison on the radio, and 
Red Silhouette tells her not to worry about it and go to bed.<br><br>

<b>Scene 46: Red of Beginning</b><br>
B.D. wakes up to find a knife on the floor and blood stains.<br><br>

<b>Scene 47: Corridor</b><br>
[Area: Hallway.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 48: Voices Past the Door</b><br>
B.D. goes into the hallway with a knife. She opens the door, finds her 
father dead, and drops the spotless knife. Red Silhouette - her mother -
 comes in and tells her to leave.<br><br>

<b>Scene 49: Silence</b><br>
[Area: Room with a dead body.]<br><br>

<b>Scene 50: Red of Closing</b><br>
B.D. hears sirens from outside. Someone behind the door (her father, 
Vector) says he came to kill B.D. to sever the crime "link," but 
couldn't.<br>
B.D. comes back in to face the truth, and her mother tells her to leave again. But she refuses, as what she really wants is...<br>
Gunshots; B.D.'s father is most likely killed. The Aging Man, perhaps a 
police officer, comes in and says that the plan they (Vector and Red 
Silhouette) came up with was almost a success, but could use 
improvement.<br>
Red Silhouette won't let it end like this, however, and pulls out a gun 
to shoot the man. She becomes a fugitive with a huge bounty on her.<br><br>

A year and three months later, Red Silhouette comes to B.D. in the 
abandoned house (which is notably outside of Zebub). However, B.D. has 
retreated into her "Sian persona," likely due to her trauma.<br>
Once the Sian part of her has helped her regain her memories, and she 
remembers that night "on her own," the police arrive, having tracked 
down Red Silhouette.<br>
Red Silhouette asks if B.D. will turn her in to the police or keep running with her, and the choice, for her, is obvious.
