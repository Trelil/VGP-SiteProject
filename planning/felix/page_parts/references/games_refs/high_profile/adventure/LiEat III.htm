<b>LiEat III</b> (a portmanteau of "lie" and "eat") is a short freeware RPG by <a href="http://lieat.ifdef.jp/">△○□× (Miwashiba)</a> made in WOLF RPG Editor.<br>
It is the third and final part of the LiEat series (<a href="http://vgperson.com/games/lieat.htm">LiEat I</a>, <a href="http://vgperson.com/games/lieat2.htm">LiEat II</a>). Playing the games in order is <b>highly recommended</b>.<br><br>

<i>A con artist of many names and the dragon Efina arrive at a party in Gold Town.<br>
They find a treasure on display, and learn that a phantom thief plans to steal it.<br>
The appointed time comes, and the truth slowly but surely begins to reveal itself...</i><br><br>

This is a short story about an hour long at most.<br>
There are some battles, but they're not particularly difficult.<br>

<div id="walkthrough" style="display: none">

<table id="youtwit">
<tbody><tr><td> 
<b>Equipment</b><br><br>

Equipment for Sid and Efina is hidden in a few places in the mansion.<br>
You can get these as soon as you reach them.<br><br>

Silly:<br>
<span class="hint">Go upstairs before the incident begins,<br>
and check the left table for some Funny Glasses.</span><br><br>

Weapons:<br>
<span class="hint">Serrated Knife and Small Donut,<br>
found on second floor, fourth room from the left, in the trash can by the desk.</span><br><br>

Armor:<br>
<span class="hint">Big Liar and Dragon Aura,<br>
found on second floor, fifth room from the left, in the top-middle trash can.</span><br><br>

Overpowered Weapons:<br>
<span class="hint">Legendary Knife and Legendary Cookie,<br>
found on second floor, fifth room from the left, behind the bottom-left boxes.</span><br><br><br>


<b>First Floor</b><br><br>

Enter the center door and talk to Wilbur at the top.<br><br>

Go back out and find Enos in the top-left corner. Return to the grand hall and talk to him.<br><br>

Talk to Iris after she shows up. Then talk to Wilbur.<br><br>

Talk to Enos and fight the lie, then talk to him again.<br><br>

Go out and check the entrance door, then return and talk to Iris. Go upstairs.<br><br><br>


<b>Second Floor</b><br><br>

Try to go upstairs.<br><br>

Enter the third door from the left and check the eye.<br><br>

Go to the leftmost door and talk to the maids.<br>
Then talk to each individually to hear their stories.<br><br>

(Note: Everything in this section must be done in a fixed order.<br>
If you try to look for something you aren't supposed to find until later, you won't find anything.)<br><br>

Enter the second door from the left and check the trash can for a medicine bag.<br>
Show the medicine bag to the blue-haired maid (second from left).<br><br>

Enter the fourth door from the left and check the closet.<br>
Check under the nearby table for the key, then open it to find a maid uniform.<br>
Show it to the maid with braids (leftmost).<br><br>

Enter the second door from the left and check the message that appears on the wall.<br><br>

Enter the fifth door from the left and check behind the trash can on the middle-right for photos.<br>
Show the photos to the ponytail maid (third from left), then the bob cut maid (rightmost).<br><br>

Talk to Iris in the hall.<br>
Enter the fourth door from the left and check the closet again for medicine.<br>
Show Iris the medicine.<br><br>

Enter the second door from the left, check the crumpled paper,<br>
then the memo pad next to it to rewrite the note.<br><br>

Talk to the maids one last time.<br><br>

Once that's straightened out, you can fight the eye in the third room from the left.<br><br>

After fighting the eye, proceed to the third floor.<br><br><br>


<b>Third Floor</b><br><br>

After the fight, enter the door. Get the note from the right table and check the mirror.<br>
Enter the code into the lock on the left: <span class="hint">8018</span><br><br>

After opening the lock, walk down toward where you came in.<br><br>

Take Neil into the left door on the right side.<br>
Push the weights forward by holding the Check button and moving toward them.<br>
Eat the lock at the end.<br><br>

Take Brett into the door on the left.<br>
Each section has a correct "warp" to the next section (going counter-clockwise).<br>
The others take you back one, so you need to remember which is right in each section.<br>
The path is: <span class="hint">top-left, top-right, top-left, top-left, bottom-left, top-right, top-right.</span><br>
Eat the lock at the end.<br><br>

Take Iris into the right door on the left side.<br>
Check the darkness, and she'll show you the way.<br>
Eat the lock at the end.<br><br>

After returning to the main room, heal in the bed one last time<br>
if you need to, then go out.<br><br><br>


<b>Endings</b><br><br>

The endings branch after you go up to the fourth floor.<br><br>

<b>Bad Ending</b><br><br>

<span class="hint">As Teo, just keep going forward.<br>
The boss will be unbeatable.</span><br><br>

<b>Normal Ending</b><br><br>

<span class="hint">Go into the eye in the hallway as Teo (check it twice).<br>
The boss will then be beatable.</span><br><br>

<b>Happy Ending</b><br><br>

<span class="hint">In addition to going into the eye as Teo, Efina must be level 12 or higher.<br>
This is checked when you go onto the rooftop, so you can just<br>
fight the last lie before that repeatedly to level up.<br>
If you want access to free healing, your last chance is<br>
after you leave the three dragons, but before you go to the fourth floor.</span>
