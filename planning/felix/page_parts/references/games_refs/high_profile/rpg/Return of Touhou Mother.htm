<b>Return of Touhou Mother</b> is an RPG Maker 2000 game created by 
S-tele. He also has the assistance of Kirai Shouen on graphics, mao and 
ALiCE TAiL on music, and Miho on programming (particularly the battle 
system).<br>
It's the sequel to <a href="http://vgperson.com/games/touhoumother.htm">Touhou Mother,</a> and is being similarly posted in video format to NicoNico Douga (starting December 24th, 2010).<br>
Currently, two betas have been released, the latter going up to the end of Chapter 5.<br><br>

<font id="size3">ATTENTION: This game is not dead until S-tele says so.</font><br>
I'll keep up to date with videos whenever they're posted, and will 
translate the game when it's finished. But S will work at his own pace -
 and due to low interest, that pace is going to be very slow.<br>

(The game must be run in Japanese mode. Most likely, you'll want to do this with AppLocale. See the guide below.<br>
Also, the included Save01 in the second beta will start you at Chapter 4.)<br><br>

<b>The (Japanese) RPG Maker 2000 RTP is needed to play.</b><br>

(Make sure you run the installer in Japanese mode, or it's highly likely to give an error at 44%.)<br><br>

<b>And here's the script, which will always be up-to-date with 
translations of all Japanese videos (within a reasonable timeframe 
following their being posted).<br>
It also has unofficial - that is, written solely by me - Battle Memory 
entries for every enemy, which don't appear anywhere in-game.</b><br>

<b>An English Music folder (with all the MIDI files given English names)
 is included with the beta, but here it is separately anyway.</b><br>

(Warning: You could infer some minor spoilers for future chapters from 
some of the currently-unused music present. But also consider that not 
all of it may actually be used in the end.)<br><br>

<b>And if you really want to know where everything's from, here's me explaining all the references.</b><br>

Note: I <b>still</b> have no real way of removing the Japanese "wa" in 
the level up message. Or at least, there shou isn't any reasonable way 
to do it.<br>

<font id="size3">Why You Need Japanese Mode</font><br><br>

Return of Touhou Mother, being a Japanese game, uses Japanese file names
 for many of its resources. If not run in Japanese mode, it won't be 
able to properly find these files and you'll get errors.<br>
While I do have a much more streamlined process for getting RPG Maker 
2000 games to work with no hassle now, I can't be bothered to do it on 
the demo. Sorry. <b>But I will for the final version!</b><br>

<br><hr><br>

<font id="size3">Running in Japanese Mode</font><br><br>

<b>If you don't have them already, you'll need the East Asian Language Pack files.</b> If you have a Windows install CD, I believe they're on there. If not, well, the internet is <b>pretty big.</b><br>
To install them, go to Control Panel -&gt; Regional and Language Options
 -&gt; "Languages" Tab. Check the "Install files for East Asian 
languages" box.<br>
I can't check exactly what happens next, since I already have them 
installed, but I think it will let you install them either from a disk 
or from a folder.<br><br>

Once you have Japanese support, there are <b>two options</b> for running a program in Japanese mode.<br><br>

The first option is more "temporary," you could say. It's using <b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13209">AppLocale</a></b>, a program from Microsoft that runs programs in a specific language.<br>
Run it and choose to "Launch an application." Browse for the .exe. Use 
whatever arguments you want, I guess - just leave it blank otherwise.<br>
If you just installed the East Asian Language Packs, Japanese should be 
the very last option in the drop-down box. And since they shouldn't be 
squares anymore, you should also be able to check for this: 日本語<br>
I suggest creating a shortcut. It'll appear in the AppLocale folder, and
 you can move it wherever you want it. I'd have gone crazy if I had to 
do the above every time I wanted to test.<br>
After clicking Finish, and anytime you click the shortcut thereafter, the game will run in Japanese mode.<br><br>

The second option is more permanent, but might cause changes in other programs. <b>Go to the "Advanced" tab in Regional and Language Options.</b> The language in the drop down box at the top will automatically be used for non-Unicode programs.<br>
Changing it <b>shouldn't</b> be a huge deal, and is nice if you have a 
lot of programs you want run in Japanese, but like I said, it might mess
 with a few things.<br>
Once it's been changed, you can just run the .exe normally and it should run correctly.<br><br>
