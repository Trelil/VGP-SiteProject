<b>It has existed...<br>
From ancient times...<br>
Until the distant future!<br>
In times of peace...<br>
And times of war!<br>
In all places!<br>
And all eras!!<br>
Its appearance may change, but it lives on!!<br>
This location will never disappear, as long as there are humans to visit it!!<br><br>

The name of that location...<br>
It is the Page...<br>
It is the Download Page!!</b><br><br><br>

<b>Touhou-A-Live</b> is an RPG Maker 2003 game created by Koki, with assistance from (9)^1, Yoto, IS, River, Yamimunemitsu, and others.<br>
As you can probably guess, it's a combination of the SNES RPG Live-A-Live and Touhou.<br>

<!-- <i>Disappearances; Is It Spiriting Away?, December 14th, XX12<br>
Several days ago, a number of betas from this page suddenly disappeared all at once.<br>
Seven instances of this incident have been reported.<br>
Eyewitness Miss K gives this testimony:<br>
"Before, they were all up on the Page... the DOWNLOAD PAGE!... but then they straight up disappeared in some kinda fog."<br>
This is being considered a form of spiriting away, a boundary-manipulating act performed by the famed Yukari Yakumo.<br>
All eyes turn toward her, but she denies any involvement.<br>
The missing betas are Hong Meiling, Shang, Mokou Fujiwara, Cirno, Youmu Konpaku, Ponga, and Ran Yakumo.</i><br> -->

<b>Also, I gave all the songs English filenames.</b> (May not be that necessary now that the filenames are English. Oh well.)<br>

<font id="size5">Novelization</font><br><br>

No, really. Someone was writing a novelization of Touhou-A-Live.<br>
He admits it's kind of silly to write a fanfic about an (unfinished) fangame. That doesn't help much.<br>
Here are some excerpts so you know what you're missing.<br><br>

<a href="javascript:%20spoiler('novel')"><b>CAN'T SPOIL THE GREATEST LITERARY ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CENTURY</b></a><br>
<div id="novel" style="display: none"><br>
Assuming knowledge of a certain game from about ten years ago by, er... 
Circlesoft, and knowledge of Touhou Project, it's a rather interesting 
game.<br>
Now, since it's a fangame, if you don't know the aforementioned game, well... it might be a little different.<br>
Ah, well, what do I care?<br>
Interesting or not? That's for the player to decide.<br>
At the very least, the author thought "Yahoo! This is amazing!" as he bashed his fingers against the keyboard.<br>

<br>- - - - -<br><br>

My name is Hong Meiling. Get it right, it's Hong Mei-ling.<br>
You may hear people saying "China" or "Hon Meirin," but I don't approve of that kind of nonsense.<br>

<br>- - - - -<br><br>

Youkai live longer than humans. That gives them a lot more time to waste.<br>
Personally, I spend most of my free time sleeping.<br>

<br>- - - - -<br><br>

"Your lose record could get you into Guiness!"<br>
Guiness. The Guiness Book. A book from the outside world that recorded "world's firsts" - I'd heard of it from Patchouli.<br>

<br>- - - - -<br><br>

"You are weak. And so long as you are weak, I want you to become strong."<br>
I'm weak... not strong.<br>
I don't even compare to Mistress or Miss Sakuya.<br>
I'm... weak.<br>

<br>- - - - -<br><br>

I heard a voice. A refreshing, relieving voice.<br>
I couldn't understand the voice, but he was clearly talking to me.<br>
"Hello, world!"<br>
H... Haloo... warudo?<br>
"Yes, good job! I'm impressed! You even put it into kana! The one who built you must've been pretty good."<br>

<br>- - - - -<br><br>

"Living things have three kinds of memories. Through study, they learn 
"brain memories." Through training, they learn "body memories." And... 
there's one more. "Heart memories.""<br>
...Heart?<br>
"Yes, heart. People live with their hearts. They stand, walk, fall, cry,
 grow, raise, and trust... people that do that have lived with their 
hearts."<br>
But... we aren't people.<br>
We're systems. Machines. Not living things.<br>
"But... there's no rule that says machines can't have hearts. Where are 
you going to find a rulebook that says machines can't stand, walk, fall,
 cry, grow, raise, and trust?"<br>
...No rule.<br>

<br>- - - - -<br><br>

"Hello, world!"<br><br>

Hello, world.<br>
Hello, everyone.<br>
Hello, me.<br>
But... that's all I really understand.<br>

<br>- - - - -<br><br>

...One new message received.<br><br>

To my child, who still doesn't know her name.<br>
There are so many things I should apologize to you for, but I can't.<br>
For making your life one that comes to nothing, I have been an awful girl.<br>
With the Magicom, I was able to put a spirit into a mechanical body, but
 in the end, its life would mean nothing and it would be abused as a 
machine.<br>
It was... egotistical of me.<br>
Yet, I couldn't stop creating you.<br>
Even if your life came to mean nothing, I wanted to have you.<br>
Deciding that you should not be burdened with sin to atone for, I made you.<br>
So, at the very least, I would see your happiness.<br>
If... if you can, please forgive me.<br>
And we'll all play, together.<br><br>

To my beloved child. ...Alice Margatroid.<br><br>

I understood. ...I finally understood.<br>
It was what she had wanted to tell me. What Alice wanted to tell me.<br>
I couldn't explain it, but I understood.<br><br>

This was where the heart was.<br><br>

Machines, humans, youkai... in name alone, they have no relation.<br>
But when their heads are stroked, they are happy.<br>
When they can all be together, they have fun.<br>
And when they are all dead, they are sad.<br>
Inside of me... inside of anyone, there is a heart.<br>
