<b>Ib</b> (pronounced "Eeb," similar to "Eve") is a freeware horror adventure game by <a href="http://kouri.kuchinawa.com/">kouri</a> made in RPG Maker 2000.<br><br>

<i>A young girl named Ib visits an art gallery with her parents.<br>
While observing the many exhibits, she suddenly realizes she is alone.<br>
And in her search for others, she finds things awry in the gallery...</i><br><br>

The game is focused on exploration and puzzle-solving.<br>
There are no battles, and it does not demand quick reflexes.<br>
It's designed to be accessible to all kinds of players, so enjoy.<br>

<br><hr><br>

<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?s5f9ef87v74h4zl">Download Ib 1.07</a> | <a href="http://vgperson.com/games/Ib107.zip">(Mirror)</a><br>
(Please disregard if Chrome tells you the file is malicious; this is in error and beyond my control.)<br><br>

<a href="http://rpgosx.tumblr.com/rpghub">RPGHub</a> is recommended to play on a Mac.<br>
(Please report any issues with RPGHub to RPGOSX, not to me.)<br>

<br><hr><br>

<b>Troubleshooting</b><br><br>

Please make sure to extract the game to its own folder instead of running directly from the ZIP file.<br>
If you don't do so, any saves made will be lost the next time you run the game.<br><br>

If you get a DirectDraw error, right-click the EXE, go to Properties, Compatability, and try other compatibility modes.<br><br>

Control issues ("automatically moving in a direction" or "no buttons 
work") are inherent to RPG Maker and cannot be fixed permanently.<br>
To fix them, try turning on NumLock and pressing Shift and a Numpad direction at the exact same time until controls normalize.<br>
(This undoes the issue of RPG Maker getting "stuck" on an input if Shift and a Numpad button are pressed simultaneously.)<br><br>

Please read the included "Ib Manual.txt" should you encounter any other problems.<br><br>

<b>Usage Notes</b><br><br>

kouri has forbidden making <b>any form of profit</b> from gameplay videos, generally via monetized videos.<br>
He has also requested that people not modify, misappropriate, or redistribute any images or music from his game.<br>
(His primary concern is people uploading the music online, as it was made by others and being used with permission.)<br>

<b>Endings Guide</b><br><br>

The game has multiple endings, so I've compiled a guide on the factors that go into getting them.<br><br>

This guide is extremely spoilery, so <b>do NOT read this if you haven't beaten the game at least once.</b><br>
Even then, it's only recommended that you read this if you want to know <b>exactly</b><br>
how to get the other endings and aren't willing to experiment on your own.<br><br>

It does <b>not</b> give any puzzle hints or the like, so don't read it if you're just looking for those.<br><br>

<a href="javascript:%20toggleEnd()">Endings Guide</a><br>
<div id="ending" style="display: none">
<br>
<table id="youtwit">
<tbody><tr><td>
<font style="font-size: 12px">
<br><b><font size="3">Doom Counter</font></b><br>
If there are three or more points in this, things will go sour in the toy box.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">These actions lead to doom:</font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">= Gray Area =</font></b>
<li>Kicking the mannequin head in the mirror room (instead of having Ib stop Garry)<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">= Violet Area =</font></b>
</li><li>Pulling the rightmost cord in the cord room, which drops a mannequin or doll<br>
</li><li>Kicking the persistent doll (instead of moving it aside)<br>
</li><li>Failing the doll room (adds 2)<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">= Brown Area =</font></b>
</li><li>Telling Mary you would leave with Garry<br>
</li><li>Breaking all three mannequin heads by pushing them off<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Garry Bond</font></b><br>
If your bond is eight points or higher, you're able to get Promise of Reunion.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">These actions add to your bond:</font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">= Gray Area =</font></b><br>
</li><li>Reading the poster about the right-hand trick in the maze room<br>
</li><li>Stopping Garry from kicking the mannequin head in the mirror room<br>
</li><li>Picking up Garry's coat in the safe room<br>
</li><li>Talking to Garry seven or more times in the safe room (after giving back his coat)<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">= Violet Area =</font></b><br>
</li><li>Reading the diary in the rope maze near the beginning of the area<br>
</li><li>Looking at the milk puzzle (regardless of your answer)<br>
</li><li>Saying you're there or not there (not "..........") after the lights go out<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">= Sketchbook =</font></b><br>
</li><li>Talking to Garry six or more times in the fake sunlight<br>
</li><li>Telling Garry you're either "fine" or "hurt all over" (not "..........") after falling into the toy box<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Mary Affection</font></b><br>
If Mary's affection for Ib is four points or higher, you're able to get Welcome to the World of Guertena.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">These actions add to Mary's affection:</font></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">= Violet Area =</font></b><br>
</li><li>See the "sinister painting" in hide and seek, as well as the Hanged Garry message;<br>
then, when you meet Mary, ask if she's okay before Garry does<br>
</li><li>Agree that Red Eyes is cute or pettable<br>
</li><li>Agree with Mary that Ib and her will be fine on their own<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">= Brown Area =</font></b><br>
</li><li>Say you'd leave with Mary [Note: not useful, given the Doom Count requirement]<br>
</li><li>Talk to Mary seven or more times in the brown area<br>
(while she follows you around after stabbing the mannequin)<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="2">Is Garry beyond saving...?</font></b><br>
<br>
There are three requirements for this:<br>
</li><li>See the "sinister painting" during hide and seek<br>
</li><li>See the Hanged Garry message after kicking the mannequin head<br>
</li><li>Have a Doom Count of five or more (after the doll room)<br>
<br>
If all of these are fulfilled and you fail the doll room,<br>
Garry is too far gone to be saved.<br>
<br>
If Mary's affection is less than four, you proceed to "A Painting's Demise."<br>
If it's four or more, you get "Welcome to the World of Guertena."<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="2">If Garry dies, you have two options:</font></b><br>
</li><li>Go straight to the gallery to get "Together, Forever."<br>
<br>
</li><li>After Mary is done with Garry's rose, go back<br>
and get Garry's lighter to burn Mary's painting.<br>
If you jump into the mural, you get "Forgotten Portrait."<br>
If you don't, or go with the fake Garry, you get "Ib All Alone."<br>
<br>
In the Atelier at the end of the second-playthrough extra dungeon,<br>
you can get a variation of "Ib All Alone" by falling asleep,<br>
so long as Garry isn't there to stop Ib.<br>
<br>
<b><font size="2">If Garry lives, there are two possibilites:</font></b><br>
</li><li>Your bond is too low, Ib doesn't get to give Garry her handkerchief,<br>
Garry doesn't remember Ib, and you get "Memory's Crannies."<br>
<br>
</li><li>Your bond is high enough, Ib gives Garry her handkerchief,<br>
and Garry remembers Ib, so you get "Promise of Reunion."<br>
<br>
Going with the fake mother in either case, you get "Ib All Alone."<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
Continuing after an ending preserves knowledge of the endings and artworks you've seen.<br>
When you reach the end of the game on a repeat playthrough,<br>
the dark gallery at the end of the game has a path to an extra dungeon.<br>
<br>
The Black Key at the end of this dungeon grants access to the True Guertena Exhibition,<br>
where you can review all the artwork Ib has learned the names of.<br>
<br>
Getting specific endings adds people to the true exhibition:<br>
<br>
</li><li>Promise of Reunion adds Garry to the main "real gallery" area.<br>
</li><li>Forgotten Portrait adds Ib's father to the main "real gallery" area.<br>
</li><li>Memory's Crannies adds Ib's mother to the area with the "real gallery" sculptures.<br>
</li><li>Together, Forever adds Mary to the room with all the color doors.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
<b><font size="2">Miscellaneous changes as a result of choices:</font></b><br>
<br>
</li><li>Seeing the "sinister painting" of Ib (during hide and seek in the yellow area)<br>
results in seeing a hanged Ib in the lower-left of the sketchbook.<br>
<br>
</li><li>Kicking the mannequin head in the mirror room makes more mannequin heads appear in general.<br>
The room with the poster about damaging exhibits has a hanged mannequin put in it.<br>
It fills the vase below with red paint/blood, which will make your rose wilt.<br>
Later, after the lights go out in the violet area, the mirror may show Garry with his head blotted out.<br>
Lastly, if Garry pulls the rightmost cord in the cord room, a mannequin head falls rather than a doll.<br>
<br>
</li><li>Mary will only ask Ib the hypothetical "if there were only two" question if the Doom Count is at zero.<br>
<br>
</li><li>Breaking all three mannequin heads in the brown area makes more appear in the main room.<br>
Later, it places a hanged Ib near the pink house in the sketchbook, though Garry isn't able to see it.<br>
<br>
</li><li>If Garry moves the persistent doll aside, he gets the ball of paint from its stomach prior it running into the doll room.<br>
If Garry kicks it, the doll will be decapitated and he'll get the ball of paint from its head.<br>
Additionally, he has less time to do the doll room.<br>
<br>
</li><li>If you succeed in the doll room, Garry will go up the stairs himself and intercept Mary as she closes in on Ib.<br>
If you fail the doll room, Ib and Mary find Garry talking to the dolls/rabbits, but Ib snaps him out of it (maybe).<br>
However, he doesn't remember Mary's secret until they go up the stairs, Mary drops her rose, and he knocks her out.<br>
<br>
</li><li>If Ib calls Red Eyes "cute" or "pettable," Mary will take this to be her opinion of the blue dolls<br>
and comment on it in the toy box while discussing the rose trade.<br>
<br>
</li></font><li><font style="font-size: 12px">If you have the Candy in the "Together, Forever" ending, Mary will eat it.<br>
If you took the Lighter (and ate the Candy to make room), Mary will say it's dangerous and take it away.</font>
<br><br>
</li></td></tr>
