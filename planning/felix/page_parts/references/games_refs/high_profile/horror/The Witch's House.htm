A: <span class="hint">Once you've noticed the window on the door, push the frog in.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>= Witch's House Floor 4 =</b><br><br>

Q: Where is one eye closed?<br>
HINT: <span class="hint">Check in a place where one eye would be closed and one eye would be open.</span><br>

Q: How do you make sound in the four rooms?<br>
A: <span class="hint">Play the piano.<br>
Correctly start the music box.<br>

Q: How do I play the music box?<br>
HINT: <span class="hint">"12" involves the playing cards in the room on the right. 12 in cards is...</span><br>

Q: How do I get the <span class="hint">clock</span> to make sound?<br>
A: <span class="hint">Push the red chair in front of the clock, climb up, and use whatever key you have left.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

Q: What do I do in the room with the dolls?<br>
A: <span class="hint">Match the dolls with the color of the pedestals.</span><br><br>

Q: Where's the medicine?<br>
HINT: <span class="hint">The powder from the yellow flowers...</span><br>
A: <span class="hint">Talk to the yellow flower on the bottom to hear its request. Just talking to it is fine.<br>
Afterward, talk to the red grasses and ask them about how to X.<br>
Then, X the white flower, talk to the yellow flowers, and you'll get the white powder.</span><br><br>

Q: What's the proper way to X?<br>
HINT: <span class="hint">Ask the red grasses, but remember what you read about them.</span><br>
A: <span class="hint">"Plucking."</span><br><br>

Q: What do I need to use the medicine?<br>
A: <span class="hint">It's deep in the dark area. Go there once you get something to light your way.</span><br><br>

Q: How can I light my way?<br>
HINT: <span class="hint">When the white flowers are touched by rain...</span><br>
A: <span class="hint">Get the empty bottle from the shelf in the poison room.<br>
Get the petals from the plucked white flower.<br>
In the room with the skulls, line them up correctly, then pull the lever.<br>

Combine the petals, bottle, and water to make a glowing bottle.</span><br><br>

Q: These creepy plants are in the way.<br>
A: <span class="hint">After giving the white powder to the prisoner, pry open the toppled birdcage.</span><br><br>

Q: Where can I get skulls?<br>
A: <span class="hint">Under a table in the yellow flower room.<br>
After asking the red grasses how to X, on the chair next to the Talkative Plants book.<br>
On one of the shelves in the poison room - it's random as of 1.07.<br>
In the pot on the way to the room with lined-up skulls.</span><br><br>

Q: I don't get how to arrange the skulls.<br>
HINT: <span class="hint">Starting in the center, he turns his head front, right, left...<br>
From the center, is there a logical route that follows the repeating front-right-left pattern?<br>
Don't overthink how the soldier orients himself; a skull facing left from your perspective is always "left."<br>
Let the pre-placed skulls guide you. A front-facing skull is in the center - where does it go from there?</span><br>
A: <a href="http://vgperson.com/graphics/TWHSkullHint.gif">Here's the solution.</a><br><br>

Q: The skeleton wall...<br>
A: <span class="hint">You can leave by mashing the confirm button. There's no item to get. This event can be ignored.</span><br><br>

Q: What to do with the *** shoes?<br>
HINT: <span class="hint">"Let them bleed," because they're bloody.</span><br>
A: <span class="hint">Use the red shoes in front of the water to wash the blood off.</span><br><br>

HINT 2: <span class="hint">Four numbers, and a four-digit code. Which means...</span><br>
HINT 3: <span class="hint">The numbers are all single digits from 0 to 9. The key to the puzzle is the upper-right.<br>
If it's only one digit after being multiplied by 666, what digit would it have to be...?</span><br>
A: <span class="hint">6006.</span><br><br>

Q: How do I use the doll ***?<br>
A: <span class="hint">Combine it with the headless doll.<br>
Put that doll on the pedestal in the room where you arranged the dolls.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>= Ending Split =</b><br><br>

There are two endings.<br>
They split off after the very last save.<br><br>

<b>NORMAL END</b><br>
<span class="hint">Leave the house without doing anything special.<br>
Whether you get the item in the forest afterward or not has no bearing.</span><br><br>

<b>TRUE END</b><br>
<span class="hint">While fleeing, check the closet in the upper-right room on the first floor.<br>
After getting ***'s ***, leave the house.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>AFTER THE TRUE END...?</b><br><br>

<span class="hint">While there are only two distinct endings, there are a number of things you likely may have missed.</span><br><br>

<span class="hint">If you backtrack before the end, some things earlier on have changed.<br>
Most notably, additional books in the 2F library appear as you progress and read certain diaries.</span><br><br>

<span class="hint">After getting the true ending, "A Funny Story" in the library changes to a book about Ellen.<br>
Since this is done at the very end of the game, it sets a flag on the last file you saved in.<br>
Thus, I believe you need to save prior to the witch's room and <i>not</i> save over it when the chase starts.</span><br><br>

<span class="hint">You can go through the whole game without talking to the black cat, proving you don't need his help.<br>
(Make sure you don't talk to him AT ALL. Even if you don't save with him, it counts against you.<br>
The one exception to this is the distractions hallway on the third floor, which gives you a sort of midpoint.)<br>
If you do this, he'll talk with you in front of the witch's room, which leads into some other slight changes.<br>
Fummy calls this a pseudo-third ending, but you can go to either of the defined endings from this point.</span><br><br>

<span class="hint">As long as you don't read the note before the "no distractions" hallway, you're free to go to the sides.<br>
(NOTE: As of 1.07, your reading of the warning is remembered across playthroughs.<br>
Delete PublicData if you want it to forget, though this will also clear some other things.<br>
Be careful that you're starting a brand new save after clearing PublicData, or it will remember.)<br>
If you bug the cat here and say you need help, he allows you a "free" save for a no-saves run.</span><br><br>

<span class="hint">New to 1.07 is the "-----" ending, which Fummy doesn't even count in the readme.<br>
To obtain it... wait on the first screen. For an hour. And the window has to be active.<br>
After 10 minutes, the cat will get bored and tell you to move on. After 50, he'll leave.<br>
After an hour, you'll be taken to the other screen, where the roses vanish.<br>
Why do they do that? The end of the novel, The Diary of Ellen, provides an explanation.<br>
It's also the most practical way to figure this out for yourself, but still...</span>
