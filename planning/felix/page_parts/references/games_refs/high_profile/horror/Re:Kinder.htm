<b>Re:Kinder</b> is a freeware horror game by <a href="http://horahuki.yokochou.com/Re_Kinder_intro.html">Parun</a> (Horafuki Yokochou) made in RPG Maker VX.<br>

<i>Third-grader Shunsuke goes to stay over at his grandmother's house.<br>

<div id="walkthrough" style="display: none">

<table id="youtwit" width="600px">
<tbody><tr><td>
<b>The Intro</b><br><br>

It's the intro, it's really straightforward, why are you reading this.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Finding Sayaka</b><br><br>

Your choice of partner to find Sayaka <span class="hint">affects absolutely nothing except who talks and you who fight Cruel Teddy with.</span><br><br>

When you go to Sayaka's house, the door will be locked.<br>
<span class="hint">Enter through the window. If you keep trying the door, Sayaka will be killed.</span><br>
The fight inside should be... pretty easy, especially if you took Ryou for his healing skill.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Nippoyo Heartful Park</b><br><br>

Talk to Ryou about his findings.<br>
<span class="hint">When his leg gets grabbed, talk to Hiroto and just take him instead of trying to explain.<br>
Taking the other two options, either Shunsuke's hand will slip, or he stumbles over his explanation, and Ryou dies.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Versus Princess Hanauta</b><br><br>

This is the first battle where the usefulness of blocking becomes 
evident, though Ryou's ability can mostly overcome the need to do it.<br>
If you pay attention, <span class="hint">you'll notice Hanauta's heart beats for two turns, then doesn't beat, then she uses Heart of the September Rain.</span><br>
Thus, you can predict when to block.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Searching the Empty Lot</b><br><br>

<span class="hint">Aya is outside a house toward the northwest.<br>
Just run from the enemies; there's no way you can defeat them quickly enough.<br>
If you don't make it in time, Aya will die.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Versus Yuuichi</b><br><br>

Rei loses her cool at the start of battle, so <span class="hint">use Shunsuke's Pacify to calm her.</span><br>
After doing that, <span class="hint">Rei can use Hysteria to do 200 damage with each hit. This is the only time Hysteria actually works.<br>
Also, make sure to use Aya's Dark Gaze to prevent Cassiopeia on the 
second turn. If Aya's dead, Shunsuke can use Stick Out Tongue to do the 
same thing.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Versus Princess Hitokata</b><br><br>

<span class="hint">Get the Diamond Bell from a shelf in the shop before the fight and use it at the start of battle to prevent her from healing.<br>
You can also get two free Maple Cookies from another shelf.<br>
Oh, and use Hiroto's Shout to lower her will and prevent Lamentations of a Mermaid.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>The Apartments</b><br><br>

Yeah, yeah, I know what you're here for. But indulge me.<br>
Go up floor by floor exploring every open room (2F, 4F, 6F), making sure you find a password hint in all three.<br>
When you reach the room on the top floor, Rei will run off, and you'll have to go all the way downstairs.<br><br>

If you found all three hints, you will be able to start entering the password at the fourth floor. <span class="hint">Otherwise - or if you get it wrong - Rei dies.</span><br><br>

Here, I wrote the hints down for you. Aren't I helpful.<br>
<span class="hint">@ -&gt; F, # -&gt; C, ! -&gt; B</span><br><br>

Password Hint 1:<br>
<span class="hint">"ABC, 123" means that the letters correspond to the numbers you need to enter.</span><br><br>

Password Hint 2:<br>
<span class="hint">So long as you're playing on a proper computer, you 
should have something on hand that will tell you some useful info 
regarding the symbols. They give you the order to enter the numbers in.</span><br><br>

Answer: <span class="hint">2, 6, 3</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Versus Princess Utsuroi</b><br><br>

You can't beat her normally, so immediately use Aim for the Eyes to escape the battle.<br>
You then get 15 seconds to go around the room and collect items before battle starts again.<br>
While you can use Aim for the Eyes to escape repeatedly, getting certain
 items will cause it to no longer work (don't ask for a logical 
explanation, I don't have one).<br>
The "dummy" items that will prevent you from escaping the battle again are: <span class="hint">Kitchen
 Knife, Viper Drink, and Nostalgic Match (the old one). Getting the 
Viper Drink also enables an instadeath attack, so you can't keep it.</span><br>
While not necessary, it's advised you take the <span class="hint">Kitchen Knife</span> once you have everything you need, as it's a better weapon for Hiroto.<br><br>

Complete guide to victory:<br>
<span class="hint">Check the trash for the Rubber Ball and Throw command
 and the bookcase for the Insert command. Get the Olive Oil, Nostalgic 
Match, and Hard Tequila. Then take the Kitchen Knife if you want.<br>
First, use the Olive Oil on Utsuroi. Use Insert to put the match in the tequila.<br>
Use Throw to throw the Molotov Cocktail, and she'll catch fire and die.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Abandoned Building</b><br><br>

You can find one of Aya's keychains by the police box, then another by the abandoned building. Then you can go inside.<br><br>

<span class="hint">Buy Rust Remover from the vending machine by the 
police box (you'll get it for free if you're out of money) and use it on
 the rusty locker to get a Flashlight.<br>
In the dark room, keep going until you hear a thunk. After that, keep 
moving and checking the menu to see if Ryou is with you. Once he 
disappears, head back right to reunite. If you lose him, he dies.</span><br><br>

After the scene on the roof...<br>
<span class="hint">Don't leave Aya alone. Open the menu to find the Pistol, and "use" it to keep it away from her. Otherwise, she kills herself.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>???</b><br><br>

<span class="hint">Just keep guarding when Yuuichi attacks you, and he'll soon stop. Then beat him up.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Tin Box Locations</b><br><br>

1. <span class="hint">Go to the southwest part of town and find the path
 through the trees that leads to the box. (You start by going behind one
 of the crystal things.)</span><br>
2. <span class="hint">Go behind the counter at the Hag's Shop via a door on the back outside. (The box isn't visible normally because ???)</span><br>
3. <span class="hint">Find the hidden room in the abandoned building, accessed from an entrance on the right side outside the building.</span><br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Final Boss</b><br><br>

Parun's recommended party is Hiroto, Rei, and Aya.<br>
Hiroto is almost literally necessary, as Shout will prevent Yuuichi from
 using the instant-kill Flower-Ring Rocket. You only need to use Shout 
once after he "gets serious"; anything done in the "first phase" has no 
real effect.<br>
The other key to the battle is observing when he uses Humming of the Night Sky and blocking it.<br><br>

Aya's Dark Gaze can buy you some extra turns if it's effective. You 
could technically use her instead of Hiroto to block Flower-Ring Rocket 
(since he uses it only once, on a set turn), but that's kind of silly.<br>
Aya and Sayaka are immune to Humming of the Night Sky and Black Cat Wink.<br>
Sayaka can heal the party of BCW and also use healing items for double the effect.<br><br>

But of course, you can just win the battle if you got all the Tin Boxes and use the reward.<br><br>

<hr><br>

<b>Final Final Boss</b><br><br>

Once Yuuichi starts doing things besides Campanella... <span class="hint">Use the Red Rose Book.</span>
