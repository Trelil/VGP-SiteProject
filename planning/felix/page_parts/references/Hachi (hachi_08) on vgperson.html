Finally done drawing the cover for Flowerwall. I think it's the most

Things that don't make such promises have no freedom. I think freedom 
comes from the gap between one thing and another. If you're in the 
center of a huge desert and are told "You can go anywhere you want," you
 have no real will to go anywhere at all; freedom can't come into being 
without any restraints. With the protection of restriction, of promises,
 charm can come into the picture.

<tr><td>
This isn't limited to art, but functional things are beautiful. Pictures
 make an agreement with the viewer - "I'll tell lies of a sort, but will
 never lie about anything else" - and make good use of that fact. That's
 the basic logic for how realism can dwell even in what seems at a 
glance to be an absurd portrayal.

When you have a concert with multiple people, where mutual support takes
 priority, it's not necessary for a single instrument to cover the 
entire range of notes. In fact, it's an impediment. Jack of all trades 
and master of none... well, maybe not quite that, but something like 
"People who are too self-assertive cause discord with those around 
them."

<tr><td>
I heard something interesting from a guitar technician. Apparently there
 can be a phenomenon where you can use a guitar cable thousands of 
times, and it'll have a "good sound," but "it's so good that it's 
unusable." Its range becomes too broad to adequately mix with the 
ensemble, so it has to be left out. So that can happen.

My generation is often said to be full of slackers and the like, as if 
we're mistakes, and as we grow, we continue to be implicitly told 
"You're too late." But at the very least, I have the conceit that I make
 beautiful music. I believe that no amount of change in the times will 
cause a speck of deterioration in children.

A child on the roadside seemed to be outrageously happy to receive 
permission from their parents to go to the pool. People who look at 
things changing with the flow of time and say "I feel bad for kids 
today" are not few, but children will always extract the slightest 
things and bring them home with care. I feel that they're always 
striving to be bountiful.

Kitano's movies are terribly violent, but it's depicted in such an 
indifferent way, and people just stare blankly when they see death. By 
keeping it in mind that people inherently comprehend death, characters 
can be killed off one after another and die just like that. They live 
hand in hand with death. That's super cool.

I really like Takeshi Kitano's "Sonatine," and these low-stat days make 
me want to watch it. There's an air of death through the whole movie,

And oddly enough, watching it cheers me up.

Personally, I think Daikanyama UNIT is pretty big. Honestly, I would 
have liked to build up from much smaller places. But my music has grown 
to the point where that simply wouldn't do. So there was really no other
 choice. I asked favors of others to make music. So a "concert" was 
something essential. (Cont.)
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
In essence, I can't say much about my "skill at performing" that music. 
Saying this undoes nothing at this point. This is what I chose, so I 
have to take care of this myself. Thus I rented the space of Daikanyama 
UNIT. (Cont.)

When it comes to doing concerts, I am a complete novice. I was in a band
 in middle school, but I can count how many I've experienced on both 
hands. As a result of always making "music" on the internet, that alone 
matured and grew out, but I could not foster the "body" that went along 
with it. (Cont.)

This situation was never even anticipated. Not only did it surpass my 
own past experience, the topic came up many times in meetings with the

There have been far more early tickets being sold for the one-man

sorry. (Continued)

The friends you always have in the end are those in a 3-meter radius. 
Whether they're family, friends, or loved ones. There isn't any point in
 using theory to judge good and evil. People who tell you "We're still 
friends" no matter how much you theoretically failed are what give you 
life.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
Theory, context, knowledge - those academic (?) sorts of things are 
always right. But while there's no doubt about that, they won't be your 
friends. They won't affirm your life. They're always neutral. You can't 
cling to that sort of thing.

The title "Eine Kleine" might sound pretty odd to people who know 
German, but this title was one that washed up after a lot of fumbling,

that's something the Tokyo Metro does on a consistent basis.]</font>

You have no choice but to trust what's in yourself. You have no choice 
but to ignore, to some extent, the feelings of others. Whatever good or 
ill will, they have to be one-way. You have no choice but to, dare I

parties have accomplished that, a mutual love can be born.

There's an inexhaustible number of things that have kind intentions and

you become unable to move from fear.

The act of making someone enjoy themselves or delight, in the sense of

 end.

If there's a tree in front of you, anyone with sight can look at it and

When you see something new which you've never seen before, one method

"This is happiness, this is how it should be." Some people say this to

choosing to going deeper and deeper. If you want to go deep, you can go 
as far as you want - or rather, you go to a point that satisfies you. 
It's not right to be haughty simply for having done that.

People should stop calling everything "profound." They say you can find 
meaning in anything if you persist long enough, and they act like it's a

There's a biorhythm to human appearance such that depending on the day, 
you might look good or you might look bad. So what does that mean for 
looking at a single picture online and declaring someone not worth your

thought "I totally understand," and that's my oldest memory of having

When I was still young, I lamented that there was no medicine that could

Even if you have manners, if you're hostile, then I don't think it 
matters what you say. Of course, I figure the moment you start getting

anyway. Nearly everything about what someone thinks about and to what 
extent comes out in their words.

First showing a minimum amount of respect for each other and standing in
 an arena where you can both be, then communication can be established. 
Once you have that, then it's fine if you quarrel. But if either is 
lacking in courtesy, then the words and feelings will start going 
one-way, and there won't be any conversation there.

It's ridiculous to think "I'm a victim until everything is perfect for

untold injury.

As soon as words and feelings are exposed to the outside world, they

There's no need to derive correctness, and no need to take that the 
wrong way. Even if you have no reason to live, you have no explicit 
reason to die. Besides simply living, people don't have any particular 
duties, so they cause strangers trouble, get into fights with people 
they disagree with, and cover themselves with blood. That must be a fun 
way to live.
</td></tr>

Also, I don't want to be thought of as a guy who always says the same kinds of things day after day.

The reason for me tweeting these things, to be blunt, is because I'm not sleeping and I'm bored.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
To begin with, I think that all people are born equally valuable, stay 
the same no matter how far they go, live the same, and die the same. If 
you could dismantle a person's spirit, you would find absolutely nothing
 distinguishing inside. The poverty gap is a terribly selfish thing.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
Experience and your daily morals concern themselves with each other, and
 affect the way you live. We shouldn't say "We're alive, so get 
experience" - we need to examine every moment and make our choices 
carefully. People who ignore their day-to-day lives and dedicate 
themselves to piling up experience are just taking off in the entirely 
wrong direction.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>
Every person accumulates experience at roughly the same rate every 
second since they're born. So the amount just comes down to age - the 
difference is in its form. People experience good things and bad, but 
they don't need the experience of "doing nothing." We should try to live
 lives in which we don't let ourselves be stopped at one place by 
emptiness and uneasiness.

Laughter comes from discord between common sense and individuality, so

occasion.

The differences in means of expression come down to different 
"thicknesses," or "concreteness," as well as what people personally like
 and dislike. Many people will say they like music and movies, but very 
few say they like words.

<tr><td>
Words are so intimately involved in our lives that there's a tendency to
 neglect to represent things through other means of expression. That's 
why it's difficult for us to express that which can't be put into words.
 If you can't express it in words, it's not likely you can do it with 
music, art, physical things, or images either.

People can ultimately only live in small communities, so if they're

Apparently my album is categorized as "Anime/Game Music" on Amazon. 
Strange. Maybe because I make Vocaloid...? I definitely never had no 
intention of it being classified into that category.

<br>I resolved to finally update my blog again, but I don't have anything much to mention, so I'll just write whatever.
<br>
<br>I watched Japan play Greece in the World Cup this morning, but it 
was a long match that ended hazily without either getting any goals in. I
 know that as someone who only supports them when they're on TV and then
 proceeds to pay them no mind, I can't understand the perspective of 
these players who put in hard training day after day, and I can't 
exactly defend my position, but it also doesn't really change the fact 
that it was a stupidly boring game. Apparently it's going to take some 
serious doing for Japan to make it into the finals now. I wish them 
luck.
<br>
<br>I heard the popular freeware game Ao Oni was being made into a 
movie, so I watched the preview, and I was overcome with a feeling of 
wrongness. The Oni of the original Ao Oni has a certain "idiocy": an 
emptiness, a naivety. It fosters a kind of terror that you simply can't 
comprehend its thoughts. But here, it has clear ill will and hatred. 
Doesn't that give too much insight into the mind of the Oni? Humans 
categorize things as "eerie" based on an unimaginable failure of logic. 
That's precisely why you can't give reasons that allow people to 
understand why it attacks others. If you don't preserve the Ao Oni's 
sacred eerieness, it's nothing more than another violent monster.
<br>
<br>I'm often surprised, when I go out to drink with friends my age, at 
the diversity of their lives. Some work hard at companies, some are 
jobless and trying to adjust to adult life, some are already having 
children and learning about child care. Some don't go online at all, 
some watch anime every single day. We used to all be more or less 
similar enough that we shared in our highs and lows together, but no 
more. People flow in their own directions with the flow of time. I 
recall someone likening humans to a river.
<br>
<br>I just realized after writing all this, but recently I've been 
working on designing merchandise. I've always wanted to make T-shirts 
and iPhone cases, so it was fun drawing for them. But it's my first time
 doing a lot of this, so I was also uneasy whether it'd be accepted. But
 I took a peek, and I'm relieved to see it's rather positive on the 
whole. I'd like to do it again.
<br>
<br>Summer draws near.

<b>German Throwing Repeatedly</b>
<br>
<br>- Suddenly, it's September. I've noticed it's been oddly cool while 
walking around, and thought, it couldn't be... Yes, September has 
already arrived. And summer is ending.
<br>
<br>- I'm always wondering what it means to "think for yourself." To 
ensure that your intentions are not fake? Or perhaps to avoid being so 
swept up by a big wave such that you cannot do anything but represent 
the wave itself? Is it right to call that your "will"? And is it right 
to call a personality that is a collage of torn pieces "original"?
<br>
<br>- Since the words for "originality" [in Japanese and English] came 
about in modern times, it seems those for "copyright" were also born at 
that time. There's no shortage of people on the internet who are 
desperate to claim rights on things.
<br>
<br>- The feeling of "can't go anywhere" is deeply embedded in me, so I 
commonly end up using or wanting to use it in my lyrics. I don't exactly
 know what the deal with it is either, but thinking about it again, I 
think I tend to use it with regard to the notion of the irreversible 
flow of time. No, yeah, I don't know.
<br>
<br>- Self-reflection is not necessarily a negative thing. If you can 
discover bad aspects of yourself through self-reflection, you should 
certainly be able to find good aspects as well; if you can't, you might 
just be intentionally looking for bad things. I suppose you could call 
that servility.

<br>
<br>- My second album "MAD HEAD LOVE / Poppin' Apathy" is releasing 
October 30th. They're good songs. I hope you enjoy them. As someone who,
 on the internet, posted things to NicoNico as soon as I made then, I 
just can't get used to the lag from creation to release. I'm thinking 
there's not much I can do about that, and it also makes me want to go 
home.
<br>
<br>- Summer is endinggggg.

<br>It's July. 2013 has passed its fold.
<br>
<br>I started a column in ROCKIN'ON JAPAN. It's called "Monster 
Encyclopedia," where I draw illustrations of fictional monsters and 
describe their characteristics. A strange column to have in a music 
magazine, but I personally enjoy it. I've long wanted to do something 
like this.
<br>
<br>I've been making music constantly lately. Actually, never mind 
"lately," I've just been making it constantly. A lot of them haven't 
worked out. But I have to try.
<br>
<br>This year was my first time doing full-blown studio recording. It 
was a fresh experience with lots of things I didn't know. It made me 
realize what a small fraction of things I actually know.
<br>
<br>I've been thinking about body and soul, thoughts and emotions, other
 sorts of dualities. To truly create something fantastic, you can't 
neglect either. In making music, I have an inclination toward the soul 
and emotions.
<br>
<br>Apologizing has never really helped anyone. I think it's a very 
futile thing. Apologizing for negligence won't fix matters, after all. I
 always think "Don't just apologize, do something about it." But 
occasionally, I'll apologize because I can't do anything about it.
<br>
<br>Advancing the soul is unthinkable without coming into contact with 
the concept of death. If there are trees, say, growing upon the soil of 
death, surely death must be kept in mind for a good harvest of the soul.
<br>
<br>Being able to describe my actions as "kind" depends on whether it's 
active or passive. Whether it's for someone else's sake or otherwise, if
 I act because I want to do something, then that may be called kindness.
 If something comes about from passive thoughts like "I can't be 
bothered" and "I don't want to," that's not kindness, it's weakness.
<br>This is all subjective, and I can't deny it's up to an individual 
feeling that something is kind or weak. But putting my weakness in 
wrapping paper and packaging it as kindness is an arrogant and insincere
 way of thinking.
<br>
<br>I want to go to the mountains this summer. Somebody come with me.

<b>Cigarettes Taste Like Cold Cayenne Pepper</b>
<br>
<br>I was shocked to realize it had been five months since I last wrote a blog entry. <i>[By this he actually means posting You Are Ugly.]</i> They may be mundane thoughts, but it really gave me a feeling of time speeding by.
<br>
<br>What have you all been doing in the five months between last 
September and now? I don't remember much of what I was doing. Not to say
 I was doing nothing at all, certainly; I'm just not good at remembering
 it.
<br>
<br>I've long had a lot of respect for people who could skillfully bring
 their memories into conversation. Whenever I see people linking the 
current situation to a memory of theirs, I'm awed by the ability.
<br>
<br>Now, this is merely a supposition given I don't have that talent, 
but perhaps we could say this about those who develop such an ability 
(as opposed to those born with it). Whenever they encounter some minute 
occurrence in their lives, they imagine sharing it with some person or 
another, and what their reaction might be. "How would they react if I 
told them about this? Would it make them laugh? Would they feel the same
 way as I do?" They have these small hesitations in their minds. So they
 begin to simplify what happened to make it as easy to express as 
possible - taking the important parts of the story and storing it 
somewhere safe in their head. With all this preparation, their memories 
are neatly organized and these events can be skillfully recalled.
<br>
<br>Now that I've put that conjecture out there, I should note that 
acquiring any kind of ability happens when there's some purpose for it. 
And I believe the "small hesitations" I mentioned may be the most 
important element there.
<br>
<br>In our daily lives, we have a terrible fear of things that would 
hurt us, and it can be very uncertain what those will be. But the 
primary culprit is the general worry of "Will I be accepted or not?", 
and this comes solely from ourselves. The more we question if we are 
accepted, the more we feel the footing below us shrink, and we imagine 
that we will misstep and fall. To avoid this dreadful situation, we aim 
to be accepted. If our efforts are approved, then our recognition as 
"accepted" is renewed. Humans are not particularly well-constructed, so 
this recognition will not sit in one place, but will differ between 
persons and go up and down, ever restless. Each time we find ourselves 
questioning our acceptance, we're feeling the need to renew that 
recognition creeping up on us. Rinse and repeat. This worry over 
acceptance can be such a meaningless thing, especially considering a 
lack of it is just how life goes. Yet this slowly-building, hesitating 
anxiety continues to spank humanity.
<br>
<br>I didn't specify a subject - who one seeks acceptance from, or in 
what - as it could really be anything. From parents, from friends, from 
significant others - in religion, in art, in studies, in sports. Anyone 
and anything.
<br>
<br>Thinking about this has made me worrisome that I'm quite an 
unfortunate person, who in fact has a dependence on insecurity. But that
 is an issue of attitude, and I believe, for now, that all strength has 
its origins in despair.
<br>
<br>I started writing to keep myself awake, and now I don't know where I'm going with this. Does anyone want to talk about memories?

<br>
<br>- I wanted to go to Fuji Rock, but I had things to do and had to give up on it. Unfortunate.
<br>
<br>- I like pickled vegetables in the sense that when I see them, they 
look good, but they're unappetizing when I actually eat them. I don't 
like them. And to think, picked radishes look so delicious. Yet I don't 
like them.
<br>
<br>- Forgot to take in the washing.
<br>
<br>- I often think about how, if a person isn't accepted by another, 
they won't speak up about it. Would they do so if they wanted approval, 
though? In the span between birth and developing your own judgement, 
being loved by other people (mainly parents) helps you love yourself, 
but those who aren't loved remain forever hollow. I'm not trying to say 
that not being loved is a foolish thing, but there will never stop being
 people who are accepted from birth.
<br>
<br>- The things I write on this blog and Twitter are ultimately things 
anyone could say. Just because I keep saying them doesn't mean I'm going
 to create something worthwhile. They have almost no influence on music 
or art. If you hand someone illiterate a dinner menu with nothing but 
text, they won't understand it, but they can understand the flavor and 
appearance of the cuisine itself. Words are only so much. Knowing things
 by words isn't all-important - we can understand simply through our 
experiences. Words are just attached later.
<br>
<br>- The internet is frightening. It's all about doing worthless things. A den of desire.

<b>Guns Not Allowed to Guests</b>
<br>
<br>- Fearfully, I've noticed it's already the  second half of July. I 
have memories up to June, so perhaps I might have gotten here from June.
<br>
<br>- My new wallet smells like a rice cracker. It's unpleasant.
<br>
<br>- I fully realize the terror of habit. A little bit of laziness can 
add up to be months, and it comes to show on your body and in your 
thoughts. It may differ from person to person, but idleness can be in 
the corpulent or the slim. It's hubris.
<br>
<br>- I had a thought about those who are primarily raised on the 
internet. If, on a fiercely hot summer day, everyone wore winter 
clothes, and as many recognizable factors as possible were removed, such
 as the greenness of vegetation and cicadas buzzing, what would a person
 with no background knowledge think? Would they realize it was summer? 
It makes me think of the senses of smell and touch.
<br>
<br>- All things are divided into action and reaction. If I punch 
someone, it's obvious I'm going to be hurt too. Asking for permission to
 react as such would just be awkward.
<br>
<br>- I want a little fridge. Also, a new sofa.

<b>diorama</b>
<br>
<br>Good evening.
<br>
<br>I released my first album diorama on May 16th.
<br>I wonder what I'll make next.
<br>
<br>Once humans die, they're beautified. It may sound unsurprising, but it's really not reasonable to say otherwise.
<br>But if you're living fully, then perhaps that sort of thing needs 
not be considered. Beautiful or filthy, people live regardless.
<br>However, it's not something people who create things can ignore. For their work encompasses all beauty and ugliness.

<br>I turned 21 today. Putting on years is a scary thing.
<br>It makes me wonder what I can do as a youth living in these times.
<br>
<br>Becoming an adult isn't a particularly spectacular thing.
<br>
<br>I went to see the Himizu movie the other day.
<br>I won't say anything more that might spoil it, but I thought it was good.
<br>I kind of like the motif of a cursed stone.
<br>
<br>I've been drawing lots of pictures lately.
<br>Drawing is just simply fun for me.
<br>Unlike when making songs, my ears are free to listen to whatever, which is the best part.
<br>If only I could listen to music while making music.
<br>
<br>Connections to others, like affection and friendship, are almost like curses.
<br>Whenever anything comes between you, words, feelings, and heat piles up in your body, and won't go away no matter what you try.
<br>As a result, people become their most anguished, looking like the 
dry eyes of an icefish, craving for love, not noticing their own 
exclusion, and continue to endlessly torment themselves with gloom.
<br>As long as we live free, life won't end with a happy ending.
<br>
<br>It was warm the past few days, but now it's raining to melt away the winter cold!
<br>Once all this melts, I'll have to hang up my laundry again.

<b>Tea Kettle</b>
<br>
<br>I like things that are just ordinary.
<br>Once, when I was still in high school, I often enjoyed peeping in on
 the blog of this working adult who I didn't actually know anything 
about.
<br>I didn't personally interfere with the blog in any way - I was just following it to observe the drifting of an ordinary life.
<br>But after all, the days we refer to as ordinary often go by so smoothly, without any major undulations.
<br>Of course, were it a story, it would make for quite a lackluster movie, with boring scenes abound.
<br>But while I can't say for sure why - I really can't - I just like things like that.
<br>Perhaps it's a similar reason to why I like ambient music.
<br>A lack of self-interest, maybe. If the person writing that blog were anyone else, they'd have no reason to play the part.
<br>Someone simply waking up in the morning, rubbing their sleepy eyes, and giving rough outlines of their future and past days.
<br>And at the end of the day, they decide to share these things to 
reaffirm them with others. It's simple, but a compactly fulfilled life.
<br>Thinking back on it, perhaps I haven't had much in the way of such ordinary-ness myself. You might say I'm some form of envious.
<br>
<br>I didn't have any plans at all these past three days, and I couldn't really get my spirits up, so I slept the whole time.
<br>I think I slept a total of two entire days during those three days. Well, maybe that's an exaggeration.
<br>I actually sleep better when I'm depressed, though that could be 
considered a bad habit. Since as a result, my living habits get all 
jumbled up.
<br>
<br>I also want to get in the habit of posting on my blog. But of course, I quickly forget about it.
