			Let's inspect a statue, we can make it our best friend. Cierra has other ideas, though.
			Since when have we cared about setting demons free? Cierra knows nothing of how we operate. No matter what option we choose, it's indeed too late.
			For fighting the demons, we get a Book of Nanai. Whatever that is.

			Of the three dialogue boxes I could have taken a screen of, I chose this one because having to type out the correct spelling of this would conflict with my style. But yeah, the floor is gross. We can tell Lina it tastes good but that's being a jerk because it's fungus.
			We fight some slime demons that are actually worth mentioning because every one of their attacks lowers the endurance of your items. Magnificent jerks.
			Missed the screenshot since it's pre-battle dialogue I always ignore since it's usually just "DEMONS!!", but Serene says "Ein, whatcha gonna do?" Really, whatchas Ein always done when demons gonna come for him?
			Anyway, we inspect a Hanging Object and - wait...

			And Ein has bad excuses for things.
			Back in Elendia, Kyle loves using rod actions to bring in a fish. Whatever floats your boat. We get a fishing rod for fishing, I guess. Then some kid outside gives us a pouch for fishing. What? I don't remember any fishing in this game, but I suppose it's to be expected in a game with so many quick time events.
			Also, Reiche wants our Dizzyshroom. Uh, sure. Here you go, guy. When you go to jail, you better not tell anyone I gave you this.
