			Also known as Celestia and the Netherworld. Intro summary: Ragnarok is a war between gods and demons (what am I?), demons overrun Asgard, gods create Grim Angels with Diviners which end up winning the war. And then the gods disappear for some reason.
			1000 years later, the people in Riviera get in one little fight and get scared and the Seven Magi decide to start the Retribution, which is some kind of really powerful. And they figured the best people for the job would be the Grim Angels.

			Moving on the map is... different. In Move mode, it shows exits and you press that direction on the D-Pad to take them. In Look mode, it shows things to inspect and you press that direction to look at them. Looking requires certain amounts of TP, which you earn from doing good in battles. So let's look at this.

			Here's Ein pretending to be badass like Ledah. Except we actually did pick Einherjar. Anyway, the point is they won't let me use it because that Break Out did a lot of damage and I'm forced to use a Potion, since this is a tutorial.
			Of course, Ledah is too good for Potions and just says "Lorelei is all I need" if you try to give him one. This would make sense since he has autoheal, but it's not just potions, he won't use ANYTHING that isn't Lorelei.

			In the next screen, Rose explains Look Mode while Ein breaks the fourth wall a lot. Well, he's said stuff like "the R button? I'll remember that" before, but now he's mentioning the "corner of the screen" and it just sounds wrong. This time we need to look at a ledge to find a way onward.
