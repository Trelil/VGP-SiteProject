			So, since I'm such an expert at all things Riviera, it VERY RECENTLY came to my attention that it was not originally a Game Boy Advance game. No, much like Final Fantasy 1+2, it was originally for the Wonderswan.
			You know, the Wonderswan. Gunpei Yokoi made it, you should know what it is... don't you?
			Of course. Anyway, let's have a quick look at how things changed in the port.
		</p>
		<p class = "story_content">
			Unfortunately, since the Wonderswan is much more powerful than the GBA, my definitely real hardware isn't good enough to properly render some things. As you can see, the font is all messed up.
			Fortunately, this is not a problem, as not only have I memorized all the dialogue, but I figured out how to interpret the glitchy text. It would be a huge hassle to edit all these images, but I'll tell you the important changes.

			This image may shock many players of the GBA version: yes, Ledah's name is now Ecthel. However, to make up for this, he is much more manly and transparent than before. And by before I mean in the future.

			Oh god I can't even joke about this. Ein just looks terrible. I suppose it still kind of looks like the sprite (none of which changed), but geez. I swear, Ein better get a manlier portrait after Chapter 1, because no one can be attracted to this.

			Roze tells us to Move Modotte. But it's a typo; she really wants us to Move Modo Tei. So I guess Tewi is telling me not to pick Easy Modo, which I must have accidentally done before I realized how the text glitch worked. Well, too late now.
			Also jesus I swear the GBA version explains this in far fewer text boxes. You can tell I was bored during this explanation because of how long and unfunny the above line was.

			...And then the sword broke. Well, it couldn't have been that good, then! Our (lack of) A-mashing is more powerful than any sword.
			And then a lot of non-interesting things happened. Who could have guessed I wouldn't have much to say about the first chapter of the original version of a game I've already LPed the first chapter of, except this time I can't read anything?
			The chiptune music is pretty good, though. You should use whatever legal methods possible to listen to it.
