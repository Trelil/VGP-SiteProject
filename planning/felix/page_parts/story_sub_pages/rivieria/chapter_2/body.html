			Lina points out some wet grass where she finds a dagger. Since being nice to Lina is always better than being mean to her, we tell her it's a nice find rather than saying it's broken and not that useful. This also lets us actually have the dagger.

			Ein: Back line? Front line?<br />
			Lina: Geez! The back is the back, and the front is the front!<br />
			Ein: Um... That I know...<br />
			As far as I know, it doesn't work Final Fantasy style, where people in the back are weaker. Enemies attack whoever is in front of them, and I assume they also have wide/piercing attacks like I do, so it's kind of important I guess.
