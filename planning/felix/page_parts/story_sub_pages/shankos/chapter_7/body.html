			The final boss of Shanko's Legacy! Sorta. Those fireballs circle around, and other fireballs bounce around randomly, and there's these giant X things that come out of the core and destroy platforms. It's an endurance thing. I died pretty quickly.
			And kept dying.
			And according to Shanko, it's supposed to end eventually, but it's so incredibly annoying and long I never made it.
