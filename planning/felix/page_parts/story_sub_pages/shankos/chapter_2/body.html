			PS. I'm trying to crop as many screens as I can, but that isn't many, so sorry for all the huge images. I'd transcribe some of the text, but the many ways in which Shanko presents it are too good to pass up.<br />
			PPS. Why am I putting postscripts before the update?<br />
			Chapter 2: Some Lab<br />

			Oh yeah, I collected all those crystal things and this is all I have to show for it. As far as I know, this never affects anything for the rest of the game. You're the best, Shanko.
			So where do we go, guys? The MS Paint-colors Swamp? The valley of Vally? The tasty Dessert? Or the Impact-font ICE?
			(Oh yeah, and the circle isn't a level, it just saves your game. Sorry guys, Shanko never explores a giant circle. I think.)
