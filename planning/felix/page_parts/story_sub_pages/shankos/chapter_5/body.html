			This level is a stroke of genius from Shanko. You have to step on the pressure switch to let out the moving platform (which is turning on and off because of the cannons), then drop two falling blocks onto it when it passes under so they cover the top two spikes and you can push the crate on them. This would be great if, when you stood on the top blue block, you didn't die.
		</p>
		<p class = "story_content">
			Instead of a fairly clever use of a glitch, you're supposed to - <strong>I think</strong> - trap the platform between those two far left stacks of falling blocks and deal with pushing on a buggy moving platform to get the crate on the switch.

			This boss just jumps and shoots the Scratch animation from Pokemon Virus at you. I can't even remember who made the skin for him or what its name was. But no one cares because you just get the fireball gem thing, stand under him, and mash Control.

			That was actually really short, I should have posted them together in the first place. Oh well, last two updates tomorrow.
