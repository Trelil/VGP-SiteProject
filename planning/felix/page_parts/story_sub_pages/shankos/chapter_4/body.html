			I tried to get to the core thing because that's what I remember having to do, but I just died, so I tried waiting a long time without dying. After failing to dodge the lightning shots (they're pretty fast), I jumped up into the corner (where you can see some Z-shots; I really don't know why they exist but you actually seem to have them all the time) and managed to get stuck here. The lightning couldn't reach me, but I was wrong about the waiting.
			Then I tried one more time to touch the blob in the center and bam, overworld map.
			These bosses are thrilling.
