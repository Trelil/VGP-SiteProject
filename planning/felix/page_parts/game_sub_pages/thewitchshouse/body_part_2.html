		</p>
		<h3>
			Witch's House Floor 5
		</h3>
		<p>
			Q: What do I do in the room with the dolls?
		</p>
		<p>
			A: Match the dolls with the color of the pedestals.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: Where's the medicine?
		</p>
		<p>
			HINT: The powder from the yellow flowers...
		</p>
		<p>
			A: Talk to the yellow flower on the bottom to hear its request. Just talking to it is fine.
			Afterward, talk to the red grasses and ask them about how to X.
			Then, X the white flower, talk to the yellow flowers, and you'll get the white powder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: What's the proper way to X?
		</p>
		<p>
			HINT: Ask the red grasses, but remember what you read about them.
		</p>
		<p>
			A: "Plucking."
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: What do I need to use the medicine?
		</p>
		<p>
			A: It's deep in the dark area. Go there once you get something to light your way.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: How can I light my way?
		</p>
		<p>
			HINT: When the white flowers are touched by rain...
		</p>
		<p>
			A: Get the empty bottle from the shelf in the poison room.
			Get the petals from the plucked white flower.
			In the room with the skulls, line them up correctly, then pull the lever.
			This will pour water into the room with the big hole.
			Combine the petals, bottle, and water to make a glowing bottle.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: These creepy plants are in the way.
		</p>
		<p>
			A: After giving the white powder to the prisoner, pry open the toppled birdcage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: Where can I get skulls?
		</p>
		<p>
			A: Under a table in the yellow flower room.
			After asking the red grasses how to X, on the chair next to the Talkative Plants book.
			On one of the shelves in the poison room - it's random as of 1.07.
			In the pot on the way to the room with lined-up skulls.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: I don't get how to arrange the skulls.
		</p>
		<p>
			HINT: Starting in the center, he turns his head front, right, left...
			From the center, is there a logical route that follows the repeating front-right-left pattern?
			Don't overthink how the soldier orients himself; a skull facing left from your perspective is always "left."
			Let the pre-placed skulls guide you. A front-facing skull is in the center - where does it go from there?
		</p>
		<p>
			A: <a href = "http://vgperson.com/graphics/TWHSkullHint.gif">Here's the solution</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: The skeleton wall...
		</p>
		<p>
			A: You can leave by mashing the confirm button. There's no item to get. This event can be ignored.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: What to do with the *** shoes?
		</p>
		<p>
			HINT: "Let them bleed," because they're bloody.
		</p>
		<p>
			A: Use the red shoes in front of the water to wash the blood off.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: The number door... (NOTE: This puzzle was removed from newer versions.)
		</p>
		<p>
			HINT 1: Check the corners of the room.
		</p>
		<p>
			HINT 2: Four numbers, and a four-digit code. Which means...
		</p>
		<p>
			HINT 3: The numbers are all single digits from 0 to 9. The key to the puzzle is the upper-right.
			If it's only one digit after being multiplied by 666, what digit would it have to be...?
		</p>
		<p>
			A: 6006.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q: How do I use the doll ***?
		</p>
		<p>
			A: Combine it with the headless doll.
			Put that doll on the pedestal in the room where you arranged the dolls.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Ending Split
		</h3>
		<p>
			There are two endings.
			They split off after the very last save.
		</p>
		<h4>
			NORMAL END
		</h4>
		<p>
			Leave the house without doing anything special.
			Whether you get the item in the forest afterward or not has no bearing.
		</p>
		<h4>
			TRUE END
		</h4>
		<p>
			While fleeing, check the closet in the upper-right room on the first floor.
			After getting ***'s ***, leave the house.
		</p>
		<h3>
			AFTER THE TRUE END...?
		</h3>
		<p>
			While there are only two distinct endings, there are a number of things you likely may have missed.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you backtrack before the end, some things earlier on have changed.
			Most notably, additional books in the 2F library appear as you progress and read certain diaries.
		</p>
		<p>
			After getting the true ending, "A Funny Story" in the library changes to a book about Ellen.
			Since this is done at the very end of the game, it sets a flag on the last file you saved in.
			Thus, I believe you need to save prior to the witch's room and not save over it when the chase starts.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can go through the whole game without talking to the black cat, proving you don't need his help.
			(Make sure you don't talk to him AT ALL. Even if you don't save with him, it counts against you.
			The one exception to this is the distractions hallway on the third floor, which gives you a sort of midpoint.)
			If you do this, he'll talk with you in front of the witch's room, which leads into some other slight changes.
			Fummy calls this a pseudo-third ending, but you can go to either of the defined endings from this point.
		</p>
		<p>
			As long as you don't read the note before the "no distractions" hallway, you're free to go to the sides.
			(NOTE: As of 1.07, your reading of the warning is remembered across playthroughs.
			Delete PublicData if you want it to forget, though this will also clear some other things.
			Be careful that you're starting a brand new save after clearing PublicData, or it will remember.)
			If you bug the cat here and say you need help, he allows you a "free" save for a no-saves run.
		</p>
		<p>
			New to 1.07 is the "-----" ending, which Fummy doesn't even count in the readme.
			To obtain it... wait on the first screen. For an hour. And the window has to be active.
			After 10 minutes, the cat will get bored and tell you to move on. After 50, he'll leave.
			After an hour, you'll be taken to the other screen, where the roses vanish.
			Why do they do that? The end of the novel, The Diary of Ellen, provides an explanation.
			It's also the most practical way to figure this out for yourself, but still...
