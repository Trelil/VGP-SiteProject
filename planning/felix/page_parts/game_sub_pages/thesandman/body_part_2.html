			<strong>The Sandman</strong> is a freeware horror-style adventure game by Uri made in WOLF RPG Editor.
			It is the second game in the Strange Men Series, preceded by <strong>The Crooked Man</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			For days now, Sophie Grundler has been unable to sleep.
			Bullied at school, and her father busy with work, she simply has to endure.
			Then one night, the clock in her room stops ticking...
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>NOTE: Uri has forbidden monetized videos of her games from The Sandman onward.</strong>
			(Regular, non-monetized videos are perfectly okay.)

		<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
		<p>
			I've provided a walkthrough if people get stuck.
			Click or highlight the black boxes to show spoiler text.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Loren Catholic School
		</h3>
		<p>
			After leaving home, get the town map on the board near Sophie's apartment. Wander around until you meet someone in the park.
			Go southwest to find the school. Check the locked gate. Go up a screen and into the shack on the right to get a ladder. Return and use it (from the menu, while standing by the wall) to climb the wall.
			Check the front door, then go check the shiny spot on the left to get a shovel. Use it to open the door.
			Go east to the dorms, then to the second floor to find Anne's room. Once you don't find her there, go to the chapel (across from the stairs on 2F).
		</p>
		<h4>
			Searching for Anne
		</h4>
		<p>
			Hint: The shadows are all lying, so use them to know where not to look.
			Answer: Go to the cafeteria (right of the stairs on 1F) and into the kitchen. Push the box blocking the lower entrance.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Blumberg Shopping Mall
		</h3>
		<p>
			Go to the mall, south from the park with the cutscene. Check the door, then the security panel. Go left and up a screen, and check the car on the road to enter it and get the security card.
			Open your inventory and check the card. Return to the security panel and enter the code.
			Hint: The numbers on the panel tell you which numbers from the card to use.
			Answer: 241917
		</p>
		<p>
			Go up to the top floor and to Theater B on the right. Open the door slightly to look inside.
			Take the back entrance to talk to Regan. Check the desk two rooms back for cutters, and use them to cut the ropes. (Or just get the cutters before talking to Regan.)
			Get the cardboard box which falls down and put it on. Make your way down the floors. Watch the patterns and make sure to stay still while squatting most of the time, only moving when they're not looking.
			On the first floor, use the doll to distract the soldiers, then run out. Go meet David in the northern park.
		</p>
		<h3>
			JP Gordon & Chase
		</h3>
		<p>
			Go to JP Gordon & Chase in the northeast. Check the card reader and the employee poster.
			Go to the subway in the southeast of town. Open the gate with the passcode.
			Hint: Check the cellphone.
			Answer: 120000
		</p>
		<p>
			Check the sleeping person behind the gate for an employee pass, and return to JP Gordon & Chase and use it.
			Go up to the third floor and enter the one open room. Check the photo on the desk.
			Go up to the top floor and enter the open room. Run out of the building.
			After being knocked out of the building, go back in. Leave again and get the tooth outside.
			Go to the central park. Follow the shadow to the apartment.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Going to the Sandman's House
		</h3>
		<p>
			Navigate the forest. (Taking the wrong path will take you to the same area.)
			Make sure to stay away from the water as you walk by the swamp. Talk to Nixie afterward. Go back a screen and enter the house.
			Show Sophie's tooth to the Tooth Fairy, and he'll refuse it. Then go to Nixie to ask about Tibbyoung Grass. Return to the forest to find it and use its dew on the tooth, then give the Tooth Fairy the baby tooth for a coin to give to Nixie.
			Continue on and check the small house. Go back to the plain and enter the log (Littlogrow) from the big end, exit it and check it again to take it with you, and place it in front of the house.
		</p>
		<h3>
			The Sandman's House
		</h3>
		<p>
			Explore the rooms if you want, and make note of the colorful stones on the wall in one of them.
			Go up the stairs and through the middle door. Go through the tile maze (from the entrance: up, up, right) and press the switch at the end to disable the tiles.
			In the next room, try to open the far door, then let yourself be caught. Keep refusing to eat the food.
			Pick up the memo in the entryway. Continue past where you encountered the Sandman.
			In the left room, get the note from the wall. Go to the right room and talk to Lullaby, then show them the memo and the notice to have them read.
		</p>
		<p>
			Go through the room of fire-breathing statues. (For the last ones, note how the flames come out six times, then there's a break.) Pull the lever in the next room to disable them.
			Navigate through the maze of clear glass walls. Your goal is the left door, not the stairs in the middle, and there are no forks in the path. Get the red bottle in the next room and use it in the maze room to mark the path.
			Enter the code to open the door on the left.
			Hint: It's really just a test to see if you made note of the code earlier. So, yeah.
			Answer: If the stones are numbered 1 to 9 from top-left to bottom-right: 178456239
		</p>
		<p>
			In the room with all the shelves and sand on the floor, get the stick and a sack from the wall. Hide in the closet once prompted.
			After getting out of the closet, go to the once-locked bottom door in the small medicine room. Then run. (You want to have the emerald flame down so the Sandman falls down the hole.)
			After the chase, return to the glass maze and face the unreachable stairs. Use the stick to break the wall. Pick up one of the glass shards. Go up and get another note from the wall in the back room.
			Enter the door where the Sandman started chasing you. Make sure to grab the mirror on the table to get around the castle faster. Keep going, and show the second note to Lullaby when you find them.
			When the statue starts singing, do four of these five things to wake yourself up: bang head on statue, use the stick, play music with cellphone, splash face with bucket of water, yell out a window. (Make sure not to use the mirror here, or you'll lose it for the rest of the game.)
		</p>
		<h3>
			Working with Unicorn
		</h3>
		<p>
			Leave the house and go east to find Unicorn.
			Go to the jewel room up the stairs in the mirror maze. Take the pink jewel... but you'll die if you take it to Unicorn.
			Wash the jewel in the water bucket in the back room. Once you've had Lullaby read you the note about the suction machine, you can use it to make a real pink jewel. Leave to give it to Unicorn.
			There's a significant choice after you give Unicorn the jewel.
			I want it back: Leads to two possible bad endings.
			You can have it: Leads to a bad ending or the good ending.
		</p>
		<p>
			Go west to the cave and check the entrance to talk to Dwarf. Get the cage to the left and catch the Glimmers on the screen left of that. Then enter the cave.
			Go back to the Sandman's house and to the fire-breathing statue room. Use the stick to help the Dust for the Translation Lenses. (If you never had Lullaby read the memo or notices, you can put them on to read those now.)
			Go to the world map room. There's a hole in the bottom-left; go down it and get the Somewhere Key.
			The Somewhere Key unlocks the door in the statue room, but first, collect the sleeping sand ingredients from the first/second floor areas. Put a piece of Crygel in the empty bottle, pick up a Snora fruit, and cut off the Caterlizard tail in the kitchen with the shard of glass (from the broken wall in the glass maze).
		</p>
		<p>
			In the sand-making room, get the hide gloves from the counter. Put the Crygel fluid in the pot. Use the gloves on the candle to carry the flame. Grind the Snora fruit in the milling machine and put the powder in the pot, then the Caterlizard tail. Pour the broth in the funnel and push the button, and finally, put the sleeping sand in the sack from the sand storeroom.
			Go to the emerald flame room and raise the lever. Use the hide gloves to pick up the flame. (You can put the lever back down afterward.) Go to the small room with the candles (left in the hall before the fire-breathing statues) and light them.
			In the secret room, put on the Translation Lenses and read the diary.
			Go to the long corridor and enter the door in the middle. Avoid all the holes on the way up.
