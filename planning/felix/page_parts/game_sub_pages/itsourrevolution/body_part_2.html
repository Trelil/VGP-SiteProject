		<p>
			At the start, don't bother recruiting anyone.<br>
			Get the Guild Guide, Chef Guide, Merchant Guide, and Scholar Guide.<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Go between towns gathering a bunch of people.<br>
			Go to the castle jail and fight the soldiers, then get Kitt to learn how to open doors.<br>
			You'll then have to drop most of your party; don't worry about doing this when you have to.<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Get the guides that require opening doors (Craftsman Guide and Servant Guide) and the Sickle.<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Gather 100 people and go to the castle town adventurer's guild.<br>
			Get Arnold (the guildmaster), then all the adventurers.<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			From there, go to the dungeons and fight the bosses.<br>
			Restock on people (and get back boss recruits) as necessary, and get guides and items when able.<br>
			Remember, you can get all those adventurers at any time now!<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you've beaten every boss, gather Sylph, Frau, Ifrit, and Dryad.<br>
			You should probably avoid recruiting anyone you don't need for ease of movement.<br>
			Once back on the world map, they unlock the Dark Lord's Castle.<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			After getting the Dark Lord, take him to the Pirate Hideout for the Goddess and the Soldier Guide.<br>
			Go to the ruins, into the left building, and destroy the object to open a
			warp to the Distant Somewhere, where you can refight enemies.<br>
			This is how you can get TP for Dark Lord's Teleport ability, which you must use exhaustively to get 999 people.<br><br>
		</p>
		<p>
			After that, it's just a matter of collecting as many members as you can,
			Teleporting out when you get stuck, and returning to the Distant 
			Somewhere to refill on TP.
