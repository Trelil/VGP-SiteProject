			<strong>Misao</strong> is a freeware horror adventure game by Sen made in WOLF RPG Editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			It's been three months since the mysterious disappearance of Misao.
			No one has any idea where she could have gone, but many believe she's dead by now.
			And when paranormal events crop up around the school, rumors spread that she's out for revenge...
		</p>
		<p>
			* This game contains grotesque imagery and depicts violence, murder, bullying, and sexual assault.
			Be warned that there are also many scenes in which characters do and say unpleasant things.
			Playing this game is strictly forbidden for those unable to make a clear distinction between reality and fantasy.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the above, I ask people to recognize that these are sensitive subjects.
			Please try to be considerate in any discussion of the aforementioned elements.
		</p>
		<p>
			(I've also translated Sen's second game, <strong>Mad Father</strong>.)

		<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
		<p>
			As you will soon discover (if you haven't already), the main goal of Misao is to collect six... parts.
			The game is rather non-linear, so it makes most sense to give the steps for getting each part.
		</p>
		<p>
			I spoiler-tagged a few of the puzzles; click or highlight the black boxes to show the spoiler text.
			Remember you can get hints in the 2F Library, so I suggest looking at those before you consult this walkthrough.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Brain
		</h3>
		<p>
			Go to Class 2-A (2F) and free Sohta from the locker.
			Examine the locker Sohta was in to find a Locker Key.
			Go to the 1F Staff Room and use the key to open the lockers there.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Head
		</h3>
		<p>
			Go through the scene with Yoshino in the 1F Science Lab. You'll end up covered in blood.
			Get the Bat from the locker in the 1F Hall.
			Go outside from 1F to the Abyss and go down the well.
			Smash the boulders with the Bat, but be careful...
		</p>
		<p>
			There are secret hiding spots in the sides of the hallway. After smashing the third boulder, run back and hide in them.
			Step into the water to wash off the blood. The way will then open.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Eyes
		</h3>
		<p>
			Get the Lilies from the 2F Library.
			Examine the blackboard in the 1F Hall for a hint on what to do with the Lilies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Go to Class 2-A (2F), 2-B (2F), and 3-C (3F) and check the corresponding desks (marked A, B, and C) to find vases. Put Lilies in each.
			After all the spots have been adorned, go to the Rooftop from 3F.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Arms
		</h3>
		<p>
			After freeing Sohta from the Class 2-A (2F) locker, go to the 1F Infirmary.
			Go to the 1F Staff Room and look for the tranquilizer as instructed, then return to the 1F Infirmary.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Legs
		</h3>
		<p>
			Get the Bat from the locker in the 1F Hall.
			Go to the 3F Principal's Office and smash the vase with the Bat for the Emergency Exit Key.
			Go to the right 2F hallway and use the key in the room ahead.
			After the scene, go to the 1F Boys' Bathroom and open the car door.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Heart
		</h3>
		<p>
			Go into the Girls' Bathroom and knock on the far-right door three times.
			Flush the toilet in the stall that opens, then get around Hanako to get Coins from the other toilet.
			(If you're having trouble with Hanako, try luring her to one side, wait for her "dash," and then run past on the other side.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Use the Coins in the 1F Hall vending machine to get Pocari Sweat.
			Go into the 1F Boys' Bathroom to see a scene with Saotome and Tohma.
			Find Tohma in Class 3-C (3F). Take him to the 2F Library.
			Give Tohma the Pocari Sweat to get the Small Key.
			Check the capsule containing the mandrake in the 1F Science Lab to release it.
			Read the note on the table about salt mandrakes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Get Salt from the mandrake. Guide it right below the telephone to make it faint from fright.
			Place Salt on the floor in the left 2F hallway (in the place where the spirit appears) to stop the looping.
			In the 2F Music Room, sit still in the chair and listen.
			Use the Small Key to open the chest for the Boot Disc.
			Use the Boot Disc on the upper machine in the 1F Science Lab. There's a hint for the password nearby.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first password is 78450.
			Go around the capsules and input another password on the terminal there.
			The second password is 31269.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Ending
		</h3>
		<p>
			Once you have all the parts, go to the Altar outside, place the parts, and inspect the lantern at the top.
			Return to Onigawara to find out the last thing you need to do.
			Make your choice, use the Bat, then return to the Altar.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Truth
		</h3>
		<p>
			The true ending is rather straightforward, so I don't think a walkthrough is necessary.
			The secret password it asks for at the end can be learned by talking to Onigawara and choosing the invisible third option.
			If you don't want to go back to find it, it's <strong>ABANDONHOPE</strong> in all caps.
