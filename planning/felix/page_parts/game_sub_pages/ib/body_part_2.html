			Usage Notes
		</h2>
		<p>
			Kouri has forbidden making any form of profit from gameplay videos, generally via monetized videos.
			He has also requested that people not modify, misappropriate, or redistribute any images or music from his game.
			(His primary concern is people uploading the music online, as it was made by others and being used with permission.)

		<h2>Endings guide</h2>
		<p>
			The game has multiple endings, so I've compiled a guide on the factors that go into getting them.
		</p>
		<p>
			This guide is extremely spoilery, so do NOT read this if you haven't beaten the game at least once.
			Even then, it's only recommended that you read this if you want to know exactly
			how to get the other endings and aren't willing to experiment on your own.
		</p>
		<p>
			It does not give any puzzle hints or the like, so don't read it if you're just looking for those.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Doom Counter
		</h3>
		<p>
			If there are three or more points in this, things will go sour in the toy box.
		</p>
		<h4>
			These actions lead to doom:
		</h4>
		<h5>
			Gray Area
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Kicking the mannequin head in the mirror room (instead of having Ib stop Garry)
			</li>
		<ul>
		<h5>
			Violet Area
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Pulling the rightmost cord in the cord room, which drops a mannequin or doll
			</li>
			<li>
				Kicking the persistent doll (instead of moving it aside)
			</li>
			<li>
				Failing the doll room (adds 2)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>
			Brown Area
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Telling Mary you would leave with Garry
			</li>
			<li>
				Breaking all three mannequin heads by pushing them off
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Garry Bond
		</h3>
		<p>
			If your bond is eight points or higher, you're able to get Promise of Reunion.
		</p>
		<h4>
			These actions add to your bond:
		</h4>
		<h5>
			Gray Area
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Reading the poster about the right-hand trick in the maze room
			</li>
			<li>
				Stopping Garry from kicking the mannequin head in the mirror room
			</li>
			<li>
				Picking up Garry's coat in the safe room
			</li>
			<li>
				Talking to Garry seven or more times in the safe room (after giving back his coat)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>
			Violet Area
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Reading the diary in the rope maze near the beginning of the area
			</li>
			<li>
				Looking at the milk puzzle (regardless of your answer)
			</li>
			<li>
				Saying you're there or not there (not "..........") after the lights go out
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>
			Sketchbook
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Talking to Garry six or more times in the fake sunlight
			</li>
			<li>
				Telling Garry you're either "fine" or "hurt all over" (not "..........") after falling into the toy box
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Mary Affection
		</h3>
		<p>
			If Mary's affection for Ib is four points or higher, you're able to get Welcome to the World of Guertena.
		</p>
		<h4>
			These actions add to Mary's affection:
		</h4>
		<h5>
			Violet Area
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				See the "sinister painting" in hide and seek, as well as the Hanged Garry message;
				then, when you meet Mary, ask if she's okay before Garry does
			</li>
			<li>
				Agree that Red Eyes is cute or pettable
			</li>
			<li>
				Agree with Mary that Ib and her will be fine on their own
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>
			Brown Area
		</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Say you'd leave with Mary [Note: not useful, given the Doom Count requirement]
			</li>
			<li>
				Talk to Mary seven or more times in the brown area
				(while she follows you around after stabbing the mannequin)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Is Garry beyond saving...?
		</h3>
		<h4>
			There are three requirements for this:
		</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>
				See the "sinister painting" during hide and seek
			</li>
			<li>
				See the Hanged Garry message after kicking the mannequin head
			</li>
			<li>
				Have a Doom Count of five or more (after the doll room)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If all of these are fulfilled and you fail the doll room,
			Garry is too far gone to be saved.
		</p>
		<p>
			If Mary's affection is less than four, you proceed to "A Painting's Demise."
			If it's four or more, you get "Welcome to the World of Guertena."
		</p>
		<h3>
			If Garry dies, you have two options:
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Go straight to the gallery to get "Together, Forever."
			</li>
			<li>
				After Mary is done with Garry's rose, go back
				and get Garry's lighter to burn Mary's painting.
				If you jump into the mural, you get "Forgotten Portrait."
				If you don't, or go with the fake Garry, you get "Ib All Alone."
				<br />
				In the Atelier at the end of the second-playthrough extra dungeon,
				you can get a variation of "Ib All Alone" by falling asleep,
				so long as Garry isn't there to stop Ib.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			If Garry lives, there are two possibilites:
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Your bond is too low, Ib doesn't get to give Garry her handkerchief,
				Garry doesn't remember Ib, and you get "Memory's Crannies."
			</li>
			<li>
				Your bond is high enough, Ib gives Garry her handkerchief,
				and Garry remembers Ib, so you get "Promise of Reunion."
			</li>
			<li>
				Going with the fake mother in either case, you get "Ib All Alone."
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Continuing after an ending preserves knowledge of the endings and artworks you've seen.
			When you reach the end of the game on a repeat playthrough,
			the dark gallery at the end of the game has a path to an extra dungeon.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Black Key at the end of this dungeon grants access to the True Guertena Exhibition,
			where you can review all the artwork Ib has learned the names of.
		</p>
		<p>
			Getting specific endings adds people to the true exhibition:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Promise of Reunion adds Garry to the main "real gallery" area.
			</li>
			<li>
				Forgotten Portrait adds Ib's father to the main "real gallery" area.
			</li>
			<li>
				Memory's Crannies adds Ib's mother to the area with the "real gallery" sculptures.
			</li>
			<li>
				Together, Forever adds Mary to the room with all the color doors.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Miscellaneous changes as a result of choices:
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Seeing the "sinister painting" of Ib (during hide and seek in the yellow area)
				results in seeing a hanged Ib in the lower-left of the sketchbook.
			</li>
			<li>
				Kicking the mannequin head in the mirror room makes more mannequin heads appear in general.
				The room with the poster about damaging exhibits has a hanged mannequin put in it.
				It fills the vase below with red paint/blood, which will make your rose wilt.
				Later, after the lights go out in the violet area, the mirror may show Garry with his head blotted out.
				Lastly, if Garry pulls the rightmost cord in the cord room, a mannequin head falls rather than a doll.
			</li>
			<li>
				Mary will only ask Ib the hypothetical "if there were only two" question if the Doom Count is at zero.
			</li>
			<li>
				Breaking all three mannequin heads in the brown area makes more appear in the main room.
				Later, it places a hanged Ib near the pink house in the sketchbook, though Garry isn't able to see it.
			</li>
			<li>
				If Garry moves the persistent doll aside, he gets the ball of paint from its stomach prior it running into the doll room.
				If Garry kicks it, the doll will be decapitated and he'll get the ball of paint from its head.
				Additionally, he has less time to do the doll room.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you succeed in the doll room, Garry will go up the stairs himself and intercept Mary as she closes in on Ib.
				If you fail the doll room, Ib and Mary find Garry talking to the dolls/rabbits, but Ib snaps him out of it (maybe).
				However, he doesn't remember Mary's secret until they go up the stairs, Mary drops her rose, and he knocks her out.
			</li>
			<li>
				If Ib calls Red Eyes "cute" or "pettable," Mary will take this to be her opinion of the blue dolls
				and comment on it in the toy box while discussing the rose trade.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you have the Candy in the "Together, Forever" ending, Mary will eat it.
				If you took the Lighter (and ate the Candy to make room), Mary will say it's dangerous and take it away.
			</li>
		</ul>
