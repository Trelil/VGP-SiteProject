			Mogeko Castle is a "prosciutto adventure game" made by Mogeko (site name Deep-Sea Prisoner) in RPG Maker VX Ace.
			It's not an RPG - there are no battles, and the story is totally linear.
		</p>
		<p>
			Yonaka Kurai, an extremely ordinary high schooler. She takes the usual train home.
			Though it's all ordinary, today is somewhat special. Today, her beloved brother comes home.
			But when she wakes, the train has stopped at an unfamiliar station...
		</p>
		<p>
			<h2>WARNING:</h2>
			Mogeko rates this game "<strong>ages 15 and up.</strong>"
			(This rating is <strong>Japan-centric</strong> and would likely be more strict by other countries' standards; <strong>18 and up may be more appropriate</strong>.)
			It is <strong>very violent</strong> and contains instances of <strong>implied sexual assault</strong>, with the bad endings being some of the most severe parts.
			I would advise against playing if you think you may be upset by such content.

		<h2>Guide</h2>
		<p>
			Though the game is quite straightforward, there are two parts in particular which require some trial and error.
			So I figured I'd be nice and give the answers here, if you want to "spoil" yourself.

		<h3>
			Door Maze

		<p>
			Middle, left, right, middle, middle.

		<h3>
			Chase to Floor Seven
		</h3>
		<p>
			Keep going up at the first split, then up at the second, then right at the third.<br />
			Keep going until the next split and go right, then open the door at the end of the passage.<br />
			Go down at the split, and keep going to the door at the end.<br />
			Go down at the split, then quickly go through the door in the open area. Lastly, just keep going up.
