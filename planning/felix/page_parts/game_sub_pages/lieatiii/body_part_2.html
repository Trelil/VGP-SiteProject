			It is the third and final part of the LiEat series (LiEat I, LiEat II). Playing the games in order is highly recommended.
		</p>
		<p>
			A con artist of many names and the dragon Efina arrive at a party in Gold Town.
			They find a treasure on display, and learn that a phantom thief plans to steal it.
			The appointed time comes, and the truth slowly but surely begins to reveal itself...
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a short story about an hour long at most.
			There are some battles, but they're not particularly difficult.

		</p>
		<h3>
			Second Floor
		</h3>
		<p>
			Try to go upstairs.
			Enter the third door from the left and check the eye.
			Go to the leftmost door and talk to the maids.
			Then talk to each individually to hear their stories.
			(Note: Everything in this section must be done in a fixed order.
			If you try to look for something you aren't supposed to find until later, you won't find anything.)
			Enter the second door from the left and check the trash can for a medicine bag.
			Show the medicine bag to the blue-haired maid (second from left).
		</p>

			Enter the second door from the left and check the message that appears on the wall.
			Enter the fifth door from the left and check behind the trash can on the middle-right for photos.
			Show the photos to the ponytail maid (third from left), then the bob cut maid (rightmost).
		</p>
		<p>
			Talk to Iris in the hall.
			Enter the fourth door from the left and check the closet again for medicine.
			Show Iris the medicine.
			Enter the second door from the left, check the crumpled paper,
			then the memo pad next to it to rewrite the note.

			Once that's straightened out, you can fight the eye in the third room from the left.

		</p>
		<h3>
			Third Floor
		</h3>
		<p>
			After the fight, enter the door. Get the note from the right table and check the mirror.
			Enter the code into the lock on the left: 8018
			After opening the lock, walk down toward where you came in.
			Take Neil into the left door on the right side.
			Push the weights forward by holding the Check button and moving toward them.
			Eat the lock at the end.
		</p>
		<p>
			Take Brett into the door on the left.
			Each section has a correct "warp" to the next section (going counter-clockwise).
			The others take you back one, so you need to remember which is right in each section.
			The path is: top-left, top-right, top-left, top-left, bottom-left, top-right, top-right.
			Eat the lock at the end.
		</p>
		<p>
			Take Iris into the right door on the left side.
			Check the darkness, and she'll show you the way.
			Eat the lock at the end.
			After returning to the main room, heal in the bed one last time
			if you need to, then go out.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Endings
		</h3>
		<p>
			The endings branch after you go up to the fourth floor.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Bad Ending
		</h4>
		<p>
			As Teo, just keep going forward.
			The boss will be unbeatable.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Normal Ending
		</h4>
		<p>
			Go into the eye in the hallway as Teo (check it twice).
			The boss will then be beatable.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Happy Ending
		</h4>
		<p>
			In addition to going into the eye as Teo, Efina must be level 12 or higher.
			This is checked when you go onto the rooftop, so you can just
			fight the last lie before that repeatedly to level up.
			If you want access to free healing, your last chance is
			after you leave the three dragons, but before you go to the fourth floor.
