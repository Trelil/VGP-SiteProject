			<strong>Palette</strong> is a freeware adventure game by Yoshitaka Nishida (Finger Puppet) made in RPG Maker 95.
		</p>
		<p>
			Palette was created in 2000 and won the grand prize in a competition held by the creators of RPG Maker.
			It later had a Japanese re-release on the Playstation by Enterbrain called "Forget Me Not -Palette-".
			(This translation is for the freeware original; I have no plans for the latter.)
		</p>
		<p>
			One night, the psychiatrist Sianos B. Sian is requested to counsel a girl called B.D.,
			who has lost her eyesight and memory in an accident.
			Through conversations with her over the phone,
			the past that hides in her memories comes to light...
		</p>
		<p>
			(About compatability: Though the game is old, modern systems generally seem able to run it.
			However, it's likely the colors won't look right. The screenshots show how it should look.
			All I can say for sure is that <strong>emulating Windows 98 and running in full screen will give proper results</strong>.)

		<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
		<p>
			This describes the steps necessary to gain access to each Shred of Memory.
			You can do the requirements to reach them in slightly different orders, but the Shreds are always obtained in the same - or at least a very similar - order.
			Thus, if you're stuck, check which Shreds of Memory you already have and do the steps for the next one on the list.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Intro
		</h3>
		<p>
			As Sian, close the window and turn off the lights. Try to leave, then answer the phone.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Knife Shred
		</h3>
		<p>
			Inspect the mirror in B.D.'s room to begin Scene 47: Red of Beginning. Identify all the outlines; the weapon can't yet be identified. Return to monochrome by checking the mirror again.
			Take the bottom-left exit from B.D.'s room. Go down in the passage, take a break with the oval, and break through the glass to get the Knife Shred.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Inherited Sin Shred
		</h3>
		<p>
			Back in B.D.'s room, identify the knife. Take the bottom-left exit, then the left to reach Scene 47: Corridor.
			Check the stain on the wall, then again to start Scene 48: Voices Past the Door. Identify everything.
			Go left from Corridor, heal, and continue on to Scene 49: Silence. Check the person to begin Scene 50: Red of Closing, and identify all except the book and the lower person.
			From B.D.'s room, go right. Hit both glass walls to make the rest area appear and use it. Take the up path to the Inherited Sin Shred.
		</p>
		<p>
			* From here on, the walkthrough will give more general directions.
			Hover your mouse over a scene name to see how get to that area from B.D.'s room.
			(Note: The direction "Down" in B.D.'s room always means the bottom-left exit, since the only place the other one leads to is the ending.)

		<h2>Guide - Ordered Scenes</h2>
		<p>
			The scenes are encountered in a fairly random order, which can make the plot harder to follow than it would be normally.
			As such, I've summarized the scenes in numerical order to clear up as much confusion as possible.

			There's a report on the Krim family's criminal history, presumably part of the studies done for The Inherited Sin. (B.D. had seemingly forgotten where she heard the name Krim.)
			Another report realizes, after the publication of The Inherited Sin, that Vector himself was subject to a heinous crime, and that his own book doomed him in a way.
			Lastly, B.D. reads something concerning the hypothesis of The Inherited Sin. It calls children exposed to crime B.D.s ("born of disorder"), and says they must be focused rather than the criminals themselves.

		</p>
		<h3>
			Scene 49: Silence
		</h3>
		<p>
			[Area: Room with a dead body.]
		</p>
		<h3>
			Scene 50: Red of Closing
		</h3>
		<p>
			B.D. hears sirens from outside. Someone behind the door (her father, Vector) says he came to kill B.D. to sever the crime "link," but couldn't.
			B.D. comes back in to face the truth, and her mother tells her to leave again. But she refuses, as what she really wants is...
			Gunshots; B.D.'s father is most likely killed. The Aging Man, perhaps a police officer, comes in and says that the plan they (Vector and Red Silhouette) came up with was almost a success, but could use improvement.
			Red Silhouette won't let it end like this, however, and pulls out a gun to shoot the man. She becomes a fugitive with a huge bounty on her.
		</p>
		<p>
			A year and three months later, Red Silhouette comes to B.D. in the abandoned house (which is notably outside of Zebub). However, B.D. has retreated into her "Sian persona," likely due to her trauma.
			Once the Sian part of her has helped her regain her memories, and she remembers that night "on her own," the police arrive, having tracked down Red Silhouette.
			Red Silhouette asks if B.D. will turn her in to the police or keep running with her, and the choice, for her, is obvious.
