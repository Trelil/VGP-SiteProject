			<strong>Standstill Girl</strong> is a turn-based RPG made in RPG Maker 2000 by Sky Scraper Project.
		</p>
		<p>
			Alice is a girl who lives in the Land of Time, in the care of a boy named Tiska.
			One day, when the hands of the Great Clock are mysteriously scattered, the Land of Life comes to a standstill.
			Though it's Tiska's job as a warden of time to recover the hands, Alice can't help but be curious...

		<h2>Guide</h2>
		<p>
			Instead of a complete walkthrough, I've made a collection of guides to various aspects of the game.
			Click or highlight the black boxes to show spoiler text.
			<strong>Many spoilers within.</strong>
		</p>
		<h3>
			Finding Items
		</h3>
		<p>
			Not much point in listing where to get accessories; just destroy all the cogs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each "area" (based on the order you go in) has a fixed set of accessories in its cogs.
			After you exhaust those, you randomly get either consumable items or Force.
			(The items and Force also scale up with the area number.)
		</p>
		<h3>
			Gardening
		</h3>
		<p>
			When you plant a Repose Seed, it starts at 0 Growth and 0 Nutrition, of course.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you win a battle, seeds in either spot grow.
			Growth increases by 1, and Nutrition increases by Force earned divided by 2.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the plant reaches Growth 10, it can't get any more nutrition.
			Nutrition maxes at 999. However, only the last digit of Nutrition really matters.
		</p>
		<p>
			Up to Growth 4, Repose Seeds remain Repose Seeds.
			From Growth 5 to 9, they can be Gerberas (Nutrition ends in 2), Begonias (4),
			Alstroemerias (6), or Joy Flowers (anything else).
			At Growth 10, if the last digit is 6, it's a Fig of Loss; otherwise, it's a Pleasure Fruit.
		</p>
		<p>
			The last digit is difficult enough to manipulate that it might as well be random.
			But there's the info, just in case you wanted to know the exact workings.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Extra Bosses
		</h3>
		<p>
			There are two extra bosses in Farsdale Hospital if you beat all five red Shadelings.
			...That's all I'm going to say about that.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Getting Skills
		</h3>
		<p>
			Except for the red Shadeling rewards, all skills are learned
			at the end of a battle once the conditions for learning it are met.
			All usage counts are cumulative, not in a single battle.

		<h3>
			Endings
		</h3>
		<p>
			To easily see all the endings, save after the cutscene where the hands are returned.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Ending A
		</h4>
		<p>
			If you try to enter the door and tell Gulinello you want
			to take the punishment instead, he won't let you go in ahead of Tiska,
			so you'll be forced to go talk to Tiska and see Ending B or C.
			Instead, say you want to ask Order about forgoing the punishment.
			When you reach World's Beginning, say you want to save Tiska.
			If you don't, you'll be locked onto the other endings (and have to walk all the way back).
		</p>
		<h4>
			Ending B
		</h4>
		<p>
			Talk to Tiska and go through the Garden of Creation.
			Watch over him.
		</p>
		<h4>
			Ending C (<strong>True</strong>)
		</h4>
		<p>
			Talk to Tiska and go through the Garden of Creation.
			"..." over him, and then...
		</p>
		<h3>
			Titles
		</h3>
		<p>
			Order gives you various titles in Alice's Backyard. There's not much point to them, though.
			She chooses the first one on this list that applies.
