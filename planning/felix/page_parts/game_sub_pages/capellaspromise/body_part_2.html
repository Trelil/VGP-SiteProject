		<p>
			In a far-off corner of the land of Ilnacia, siblings Velk and Thiana run an underground slave market.
			One rainy night, a customer arrives with an unusual request: for the two to take a girl into their care for six months.
			Offered a large sum, Thiana accepts without a second thought. But great danger looms on the horizon...
		</p>
		<p>
			Capella's Promise is a JRPG made by PlainSoft in RPG Maker VX Ace.
			It has a main plot about 20+ hours long with optional sidequests and many other gameplay features, including:
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Specialize system, where SP won from battles can be used to level up Specialties and learn moves or passive skills.</li>
				<li>An item synthesis system, where you can use raw materials to create anything you have the recipe for.</li>
				<li>Fully-randomized equipment dropped by enemies, as well as fixed equipment from shops and the like.</li>
				<li>A fortification system of embedding Orbs into equipment to grant it additional properties and stat boosts.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Installation of the RPG Maker VX Ace RTP is required to play.

		<h2>Help</h2>

		<p>For the most part, the plot lets you know exactly where you need to go next.
		The Progress screen will also remind you of where to go at all times.</p>

		<p>However, there are times when this may be insufficient, and there is less guidance in sidequests.
		Check here if you have a problem of this nature. Descriptions may contain spoilers, but as few as possible.
		(Also, I have little to offer in the way of battle strategies. Sorry.)</p>

		<h3>Main Story: Where am I supposed to search in the archives?</h3>

		<p>There's a switch in the bottom-right bookshelf in the room where you fought the boss.
		However, you'll need to use Manarel Dust to light the torch near the shelf to be able to see and interact with the switch.
		(This is an introduction to the idea of revealing items by lighting torches, though it's entirely optional other than this, generally only getting you extra materials.)</p>

		<h3>Quests: I'm missing a quest and I don't know where...</h3>

		<p>Two of the easiest quests to miss are Orlando's in Prismriver.
		After you do Nagura's quest and get the Small Beer Bottle, you aren't alerted to it at all, but you can give it to Orlando nearby to fill him with energy and get a quest from him.
		Once you complete that quest, you'll get the Crystal Key Seal. Restore the Crystal Key at the Ancient Forge and give it to Orlando to get a second quest.</p>

		<p>Since you're never required to go to it, you may miss the town of Orge entirely. Go south from the entrance to Persadal to reach it, then go east to Seaside Path to find Maple, who has a quest.</p>

		<p>Another one you could miss is the very last quest. Zeke only appears in the castle center if you've liberated that area and freed the people in the dungeon west of the courtyard.</p>

	<div class = "guide">
		<p>Miscellaneous information, mostly about how to get 100% of everything.
		There are spoilers for the entire game within!</p>

		<h3>One-Time Rewards</h3>

		<p>There are three ingredients around Sugar to put in the gross Cranberry 
		Tea. You only need one, but the number you collect changes the reward 
		you get from the messenger: a Manarel Shard for one, a Shiny Manarel for
		 two, and an Engrave Orb for three.</p>


		<p>During the ship segment, there are two quasi-sidequests.</p>

		<p>The first: Before the Devil's Sea part, read the notice near your room, 
		and defeat the ants at all three marked barrels. You will receive a 
		Silver Idol once you reach Lumist.</p>

		<p>The second: Read the notice after the Devil's Sea and talk to Pearl on 
		the bottom deck to get her cooking. Give it to the captain after Blue 
		Orion leaves. You will receive a Shiny Manarel once you reach Lumist.</p>


		<h3>Healing Mechanics</h3>

		<p>The cost of healing at crescent moon monuments is based on Velk's level 
		squared; other members' levels and number of moon monument uses have no 
		bearing. Each Faith Talisman reduces the cost by 4%.</p>

		<p>During certain parts of the game, usually when you have a small party, 
		the cost is reduced to a fifth of the usual. The maximum amount healing 
		can ever cost is 5,000 Galuc.</p>

		<p>The cost of inns, on the other hand, is simply double Velk's level plus 5.</p>


		<h3>Material Gathering</h3>

		<p>Materials picked up from the ground/walls/water (in "overworld" areas, 
		not in dungeons) don't go away forever; there's a timer that puts back a
		 scattered selection of materials every 100 seconds. It does this in six
		 groups, so any given material is guaranteed to respawn within 10 
		minutes.</p>

		<p>However, the timer also advances 20 to 30 seconds when you beat an 
		enemy. Note, though, that the timer doesn't run during battles, so 
		you're only saving time if you win faster than that.</p>


		<h3>Rozea's Rewards</h3>

		<p>Rozea in the northeast corner of Lumist gives rewards for every five 
		Thank-You Notes you get from completing quests. There are a total of 40 
		quests.</p>

		<h4>5: Manarel Shard x5</h4>
		<p>Raw materials for synthesis.</p>

		<h4>10: Restore Jewel</h4>
		<p>Used at the Ancient Forge to restore sealed items.</p>

		<h4>15: Astrology Compass</h4>
		<p>Allows you to influence chests to more often contain a specific type of equipment (weapon, shield, armor, helmet, accessory).</p>

		<h4>20: Spirit Compass</h4>
		<p>Allows you to influence the elemental resistances of random equipment.</p>

		<h4>25: Medicine of Meusta</h4>
		<p>A powerful Tome weapon.</p>

		<h4>30: Orion Ring</h4>
		<p>A ring that adds 200 Luck.</p>

		<h4>35: Entry Permit B5F</h4>
		<p>Allows entry to the bottom floor of Chardam.
		The most notable rewards there are recipes for the Diffusion, Almighty, and Engrave Orbs.</p>

		<h4>40: Doldoa Silver Crown</h4>
		<p>The crown that was, uh, stolen from the entrance to Sanuzam Ruins in Distana.
		If you put it back on that pedestal, it opens the door. You can get the
