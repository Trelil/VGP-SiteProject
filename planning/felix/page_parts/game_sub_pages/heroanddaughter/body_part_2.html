			Hero & Daughter is a dungeon-crawling hack-and-slash RPG by tachi made in RPG Maker VX Ace.
			The game is primarily about running dungeons for loot and levels until you grow powerful enough to clear them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The veteran hero Ralph has been punished for his hubris by being dropped down to Level 1.
			Unable to level up whatsoever, all seems hopeless until he finds a helpful summoner.
			By having him summon girls to join the fight, perhaps the dark lord can be defeated yet...
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that the girls in the game are not "the hero's daughters" or anything. (Though I suppose they're their parents' daughters.)
			Basically, it's just an oddly literal translation of the word "musume" (girl) that would have been more odd to change.

		<h2>Updates</h2>
		<p>
			Tachi generally shoots for weekly updates around Friday or Saturday.
			Whenever updates happen, I'll try to have the English version updated within a day or two of release.
			Updates are estimated to continue until around February or March.
		</p>
		<p>
			When you download a new version, you can simply copy your "SaveXX.rvdata2" files to that version.
			You'll even get a random special item when you change versions!

		<h3>Getting Village EXP</h3>
		<p>
			The village's level goes up to 100, with experience requirements following the pattern 300 * PreviousLevel2.
			Girls who stay behind at the village provide EXP each expedition, which goes as high as their LUK and as low as... slightly less than that.
			Shopping at the Item, Spell, and Accessory Shops adds GoldSpent/10 EXP. Selling items at the Guild adds GoldEarned/10 EXP.
			When you defend the village, you earn EnemyTier * 100 EXP. When you fail to defend it, you lose VillageLevel * 200 EXP.
		</p>

		<h3>Effects of Leveling Village</h3>
		<p>
			The Item and Spell Shops get one more item/low-level spell in stock each level up to 18.
			At level 20, the Spell Shop starts getting a new high-level spell every 5 levels up to 80.
			The Accessory Shop gets new, more affectionate gifts at level 4, 7, 10, and 13.
			Defense encounters are unrelated to village level; you advance to a harder tier every time you win, and go back to 1 when you lose.
		</p>
		<p>
			Restaurant meals add more stat points at higher village levels, and are also twice as effective if the stats in question are low.
			(This stat check is based on the stats with equipment rather than base stats, so unequip Ralph for best effect.)
			The HP/MP meals add 5 * Level, but it's 10 * Level if you have less than 1000 in the stat.
			ATK/DEF/MAT/MDF/AGI/LUK are all 1 * Level, but 2 * Level if you have less than 150 in the stat.
			(It's coded to go one level at a time, so if it crosses over the "low stat" threshold midway, it will switch to the lesser one.)

			Affection Levels

		</tbody></table>
		<p>
			<strong>(Note that not all girls have a full set of conversations yet. They should all have 15 eventually.)</strong>
			Affection has no practical gameplay effects; it only yields more conversations with each girl in the pub.
			You gain 1 affection with a girl every "weak enemy" you battle with her in the party, and can give accessories as gifts to add more.
			Every time you have a new conversation with a girl in the pub, even the first 0-affection one, you get 5 bonus affection points.
			The Level 8 conversation is the most "major" one, generally marking a turning point and including a special illustration of that girl.
			Once you reach village level 8, a clown in the top-left of the village will reset all conversations, allowing you to (with enough affection) rewatch them all through.

		<p>
			You can use Goral to guarantee encountering a certain Map ID to ensure you find a wanted monster.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Summoning Mechanics
		</h3>
		<p>
			Lara is always summoned automatically in the intro.
			All the other girls are picked completely at random when you use a Summon Stone.
			If it picks a girl you already summoned, it rolls the dice again in an attempt to get one you haven't.
			After enough rerolls without a new girl, it will eventually settle for the Memories item of a girl you already have.
			(The Memories are chosen without regard for which ones you've gotten; it'll gladly give you useless duplicates.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Candy Lix can only be summoned after you defeat her (as a rare enemy encounter).
			Dark Lord Arue can only be summoned after you defeat her at the True Dark Lord's Castle.
			Spirit Queen can only be summoned after defeating the second dark lord.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Return Scene/Defense Mechanics
		</h3>
		<p>
			There are "plot" scenes that play after your first expedition and after first beating each dungeon.
			Plot scenes take precedent over everything else. If there are none to play, there's a 30% chance it'll pick a random return scene.
			If you have the girl(s) for the random scene and have not seen it, it will play; otherwise, it will reroll up to 90 times.
		</p>
		<p>
			If no scene is chosen, it checks if the village should be attacked.
			However, the village cannot be attacked if there are less than two girls working in the village.
			If there are enough girls, and you've gone at least one trip without an attack, then it's possible there will be an attack.
			The odds increase the longer you go without one, becoming a certainty after eight times.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Challenge Tower Stuff
		</h3>
		<p>
			After beating Dahklorde, you unlock Challenge Tower on the left side of the village.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's a boss every 10 floors, and beating it will give you a checkpoint you can return to from the base.
			Beating the 100F boss will get you the C-Charger when you return to the Challenge Tower area.
			This is a one-of-a-kind accessory that gives the holder 5x EXP gain.
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to CP gained in battles and from Tower chests, there are three CP bonuses.
			The C-Floor bonus simply gives FloorNum CP when you reach a new floor, maxing out at 1000.
			The C-Win bonus gives you FloorNum * 5 CP for beating normal enemies on a floor.
			The C-Wipe bonus gives you FloorNum * 10 CP for losing to normal enemies, but maxes at 1000.
		</p>
		<p>
			Switches cost FloorNum * 5 CP (up to 5000) per use. They cause random effects, all beneficial.
			Either the party gets recovered for HP/MP/TP/all three, or you get an advantage in the next Challenger battle.
		</p>
		<p>
			After beating 100F, if you've done 30 dungeon dives, floors 101 to 1000 will unlock when you enter the lobby.
			Here, there's a boss and checkpoint every 100 floors. But don't worry - warp circles start to appear after 100F.
			Warp circles will take you up a random amount of floors, as many as 30 (there's about a 21% chance of going up 30).
			Obviously, warp circles will stop at boss floors. No skipping past those, unfortunately.
			Beating the 1000F boss will get you the C-Magic Herb, which halves magic cost.
		</p>
		<p>
			After beating 1000F, if you've used enough stat-ups to add a total of 1,000 stat points, you unlock up to 9999F.
			You guessed it - a boss every 1000 floors. But the warp circles change to accomodate.
			Warp circles on 1001F and up will take you up as many as 200 floors, with about a 13% chance of reaching that limit.
			Beating the 9999F boss (good luck) will get you the C-Magic Avoid, which adds 50% magic evasion.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Enemy Spawn Mechanics
		</h3>
		<p>
			By default, about 85% of all possible enemies will spawn in.
			When Goral is told to reduce enemies, about 25% do. When told to increase them, 100% of them will.
		</p>
		<p>
			About 68% of enemy spawns are "weak" (slimes), 16% are "strong" (reapers), and 16% are "rare" (yellow ghosts).
			However, there can only be as many as two "special" (strong or rare) spawns per floor.
			(Yes, this means a larger number of enemies can actually hurt your chances of getting a rare spawn.)
			A rare enemy spawn has just three possibilities for which group you'll fight, independent of dungeon:
			Candy Lix (if she's not in your traveling party), Golden Mimics, or Golden Orcs.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Chest Mechanics
		</h3>
		<p>
			There is a 90% chance for a chest to be red, 8% for it to be blue, and 2% for it to be silver.
			Chests contain one of four types of loot: item, weapon, armor, or gold. The type is picked randomly with even distribution.
			However, blue/silver chests will never contain gold, and there's a 50% chance red ones will reroll in an attempt to "avoid" gold.
		</p>
		<p>
			If "item" is picked, the item is picked at random from a pool of 29. "Gold" is just a random number from 1 to 4 times 100.
			Each dungeon has an upper limit on the quality of weapons/armor from their chests, which is higher in the more difficult dungeons.
			Blue chests have better odds of approaching "max quality," and silver chests have the best odds.
			(Decent/Superb qualifiers are based on distance from the maximum, and the rare/[R] items are the top six each dungeon can yield.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Some dungeons have a few special grayish-brown chests in fixed positions.
			These chests always contain a Summon Stone, but disappear for good once they've been collected.
			Regular chests also have a 1/29 chance of containing Summon Stones... if the chest contains an item.
			So if you want to farm them, have Goral set chests to items only.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Monster House Mechanics
		</h3>
		<p>
			After first visiting the Monster House, recruitable monsters will appear in dungeons.
			There are nine monsters in total: the Dragon is there to begin with, and there's one to recruit on "Floor ID #1" of each dungeon.
			Monsters level up from EXP and get stat increases on curves like any party member, even using new skills in battle at higher levels.
			When Ralph gives monsters stats directly, these are simply added directly onto their base stats.
		</p>
		<p>
			When monsters are set to defend the village, the matchup is based exclusively on the level of the Dragon.
			If the Dragon has a higher level than the monster tier, it wins, earning village EXP like when the girls succeed at defense.
			If its level is equal or lower, it loses, but all this does is reset the tier of the attacking monsters - no village EXP is lost.
			So activating monster defenses lets you ignore attacks, basically. The main disadvantage is girls in reserve don't get to level up from it.
		</p>
