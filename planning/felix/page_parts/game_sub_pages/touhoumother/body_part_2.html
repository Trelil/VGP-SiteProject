			Touhou Mother is an RPG Maker 2000 game created by S (also known as S-chan, S-teru, or S-tele), with much-needed graphical and musical assistance from mao, ALiCE TAiL, Suama, and others.
			It was originally posted in video format to Nico Nico Douga, starting on April 23rd, 2008 and ending April 8th, 2009. A beta was released after video 17 and a final version at the end.
			I started translating it in November 2008, being pretty awful at Japanese and having no idea what I was getting into, but I eventually came out of it with a decent perfect translation.
			But you don't care about any of that. You just want to see Reimu beat up Porky, right?

			これはＳテルさんの「東方星母録」の英語版です。 (This is an English version of S-tele's Touhou Seiboroku.)
			英語には、「とうほうマザー」と言われる。簡単に分かるね。星母録って何？ (In English, it's known as "Touhou Mother." Pretty easy to understand. I mean, what's a "Star Mother Record"?)

			Ｓテルさんには、私にリンクしてありがとうございます。 (Thanks to S-tele for linking to me.)
			私はプロの訳者ではない、でも頑張った。 (I'm not a professional translator, but I've done my best.)
			英語圏の文化が分かるためにこのゲームのセリフを訳したと思う。 (I think I've translated this game appropriately so that English-speakers can understand it.)
		</p>
		<p>
			今は東方星母続録も訳してるよ！ (And I'm translating Sequelroku now, too!)
		</p>

			日本語を書いてが苦手ですみませんね。 (Sorry I'm so bad at writing Japanese.)
		</p>
		<p>
			I gave all the songs English/more descriptive filenames for convenience.
			(Note that the names are based on filenames; the soundtrack below has different names for most of them.)
		</p>
		<p>
			But if you really want your MIDIs in high quality, how about the ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK?

			<a href = "http://vgperson.com/other/TouhouMother3.txt">TOUHOU MOTHER SCRIPT 2.0</a><br />
			This is a script of all dialogue from version 2.2222, which is WAY better than the old translation seen in my videos.
			It also includes Yuka's smashes and semi-official Battle Memory descriptions for every enemy that are part written by mao and part made up by me.
		</p>
		<p>
			And if you want to spoil everything, here's a list of all the references I could identify either me or S making, at the very least script-wise, and not counting anything that should be obvious enough with general knowledge of Touhou and Earthbound.

			Notes
		</h2>
		<p>
			I couldn't find a patch to make the naming screens English without also causing a bunch of stuff to become terrible.
			Thus, I removed the screens and had it automatically name everything the default.
			I tried making a program to edit the names in a save file, but that's hard to do and awkward anyway.
			If you really really want to change them, go look for an RPG Maker 2000 save editor.
		</p>
		<p>
			There's a folder called "Video Saves." (Note: Some of these will probably load weirdly, but should be normal as soon as you change rooms. Too lazy to fix that, sorry.)
			These saves are at the start of each video, or at least, to the nearest save point.
			RPG Maker only has 15 save slots, so you'll have to rename 16 and up.
			The saves were made by running through the game in my self-created "easy mode" where enemies die instantly.
			Initially, I "fought" almost every enemy I saw, but got lazier about that later. This process may or may not have resulted in decent levels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Oh, about the graphics.
			Shortly before S posted the finale, someone on the BBS asked S if he could resprite the characters.
			S responded to the effect of "well gee I've got all these videos uploaded and I can't CHANGE THE INTERNET" "well do whatever you want dude it's the internet."
			So the poster went ahead and did it even though S didn't plan on using them. And to be honest, they look a lot better than the originals.
			(Also, he sprited Yuka in pajamas, Yamame, Hina, and a Queen Tenshi statue, even though none of them are actually used. Take a look at the files in CharSet, including the dot2 folder.)
			Much later, MikoSpark and Shadow443, inspired by a Let's Play of this game which shall not be named but really you can just search YouTube, redid a large portion of the enemy graphics.
		</p>
		<p>
			So why am I telling you this? Because I decided to make both of these improved sets of graphics the defaults. You're welcome.

		<h2>
			Frequently Asked Questions (from the Touhou Mother Wiki)
		</h2>
		<p>
			Q. What are the controls?<br />
			A. Controls:<br />
			Z / Enter: Decide<br />
			X / Insert: Cancel/Open Menu<br />
			Arrow Keys: Move<br />
			F12: Return to Title<br />
			F4: Toggle Fullscreen/Window<br />
			F5: Screen Enlarge/Shrink
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Q. I can't hear the music.</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			A. Are you sure the volume isn't muted?
		</p>
		<p>
			Control Panel ->
			Sounds and Audio Devices ->
			"Audio" Tab ->
			MIDI music playback -> Volume
		</p>
		<p>
			There, check if the SW Synth is muted.
			MIDI sequences will play at this volume.
			If that's not it, who knows. Check Windows Media Player.
		</p>
		<p>
			[There are also some instructions on how to use a program called Timidity, which can apparently fix problems with MIDIs in Vista.
			But as far as I can tell, the program is only in Japanese. So, yeah.]
		</p>
			>Q. What does it work on?
		</p>
		<p>
			A. Windows 98 up to XP should be fine, but it's perfect on Vista. Macs? Impossible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q. Do gamepads work?
			A. Yes, gamepads can be used. It only uses a few buttons, so there should be no problem with that.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Notes About the Full Version (also from the Touhou Mother Wiki)
		</h3>
		<p>
			Q. Difficulties? So, what's the difference?
		</p>
		<p>
			A. Just like Touhou, it goes from Easy, the easiest, to Lunatic, the impossible-est.
			Higher difficulties will make the enemies stronger. Obviously.
			The difficulty in the videos is Normal.
		</p>
		<p>
			On difficulties Hard and above, you'll get Subweapons around the middle of the game.
			However, they're... [Well, this originally said they're very buggy, essentially. But I dealt with that as best I could.]
		</p>
		<p>
			Q. I'm stuck.
		</p>
		<p>
			A. Reload a previous save.
			Since you can save anywhere [...in the test version], you should save all the time.
			Oh, and you shouldn't save in just one slot, either.
		</p>
		<p>
			You might have a lot of trouble going through the poison in Muenzuka.
			There isn't anywhere to buy items in Muenzuka, and the poison will quickly drain your HP.
			Make sure you're ready with lots of items in reserve before you go there.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q. Tenshi isn't doing anything after using Scarlet Weather Rhapsody.
		</p>
		<p>
			A. On Easy Mode, that attack can be survived.
			To avoid getting stuck, please, just be a good sport and let yourself lose.
			[I'm almost certain I fixed this. I haven't checked if S did or not, but really, it isn't that hard to fix...]
		</p>
		<p>
			Q. Rinbokusan isn't in Muenzuka.
		</p>
		<p>
			A. Her location's been changed. [Since S's video, that is.]
			She's somewhere in Muenzuka.
			Where, exactly? Look, just search.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q. I can't beat those "di" guys.
		</p>
		<p>
			A. That's okay. It's to be expected.
			Only by the endgame should you be able to beat them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q. Eientei sucks.
		</p>
		<p>
			A. That's even less of a question than any of those above, but, yes. It kinda does. Here's a map.
			Letters signify connected doors. EN is where you start. Both EN and EX lead back to Reisen. DC is the Death Crimson room. GS is the Guilloscreen enemy.
			K1 and K2 are linked normally, but the "arrow-K1" door is a one-way warp to to K1, which is weird and possibly a mistake.

			Sequel planning in progress. RPG Maker 2000, as ever!" ~ S
