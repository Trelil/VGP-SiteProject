			Alice mare is a freeware horror-esque adventure game by △○□× (Miwashiba) made in WOLF RPG Editor.
		</p><p>
			Allen is a boy who has lost his memory.
			Bereaved of his parents, he comes to a certain facility.
			One day, he goes to investigate an odd rumor, and...
		</p><p>
			This is an exploration game with a storybook/fairytale motif.
			There's really only, say, a teaspoon of horror. Those not good with horror should be more or less fine.
			Don't worry, there are no chases or anything like that.
