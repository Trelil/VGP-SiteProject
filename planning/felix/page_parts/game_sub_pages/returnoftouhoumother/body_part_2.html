			<strong>Return of Touhou Mother</strong> is an RPG Maker 2000 game created by S-tele. He also has the assistance of Kirai Shouen on graphics, mao and ALiCE TAiL on music, and Miho on programming (particularly the battle system).
			It's the sequel to Touhou Mother, and is being similarly posted in video format to NicoNico Douga (starting December 24th, 2010).
			Currently, two betas have been released, the latter going up to the end of Chapter 5.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>ATTENTION:</strong> This game is not dead until S-tele says so.
			I'll keep up to date with videos whenever they're posted, and will translate the game when it's finished. But S will work at his own pace - and due to low interest, that pace is going to be very slow.

			(The game must be run in Japanese mode. Most likely, you'll want to do this with AppLocale. See the guide below.<br />
			Also, the included Save01 in the second beta will start you at Chapter 4.)

			The (Japanese) RPG Maker 2000 RTP is needed to play.<br />

			(Make sure you run the installer in Japanese mode, or it's highly likely to give an error at 44%.)
		</p>
		<p>
			And here's the script, which will always be up-to-date with translations of all Japanese videos (within a reasonable timeframe following their being posted).
			It also has unofficial - that is, written solely by me - Battle Memory entries for every enemy, which don't appear anywhere in-game.

			An English Music folder (with all the MIDI files given English names) is included with the beta, but here it is separately anyway.

			(Warning: You could infer some minor spoilers for future chapters from some of the currently-unused music present. But also consider that not all of it may actually be used in the end.)

			And if you really want to know where everything's from, here's me explaining all the references.

			Note: I still have no real way of removing the Japanese "wa" in the level up message. Or at least, there shou isn't any reasonable way to do it.

		<h2>
			Why You Need Japanese Mode
		</h2>
		<p>
			Return of Touhou Mother, being a Japanese game, uses Japanese file names for many of its resources. If not run in Japanese mode, it won't be able to properly find these files and you'll get errors.
			While I do have a much more streamlined process for getting RPG Maker 2000 games to work with no hassle now, I can't be bothered to do it on the demo. Sorry. But I will for the final version!
		</p>
		<h2>
			Running in Japanese Mode
		</h2>
		<p>
			If you don't have them already, you'll need the East Asian Language Pack files. If you have a Windows install CD, I believe they're on there. If not, well, the internet is pretty big.
			To install them, go to Control Panel -> Regional and Language Options -> "Languages" Tab. Check the "Install files for East Asian languages" box.
			I can't check exactly what happens next, since I already have them installed, but I think it will let you install them either from a disk or from a folder.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have Japanese support, there are two options for running a program in Japanese mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first option is more "temporary," you could say. It's using <a href = "http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13209">AppLocale</a>, a program from Microsoft that runs programs in a specific language.
			Run it and choose to "Launch an application." Browse for the .exe. Use whatever arguments you want, I guess - just leave it blank otherwise.
			If you just installed the East Asian Language Packs, Japanese should be the very last option in the drop-down box. And since they shouldn't be squares anymore, you should also be able to check for this: 日本語
			I suggest creating a shortcut. It'll appear in the AppLocale folder, and you can move it wherever you want it. I'd have gone crazy if I had to do the above every time I wanted to test.
			After clicking Finish, and anytime you click the shortcut thereafter, the game will run in Japanese mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			The second option is more permanent, but might cause changes in other programs. Go to the "Advanced" tab in Regional and Language Options. The language in the drop down box at the top will automatically be used for non-Unicode programs.
			Changing it shouldn't be a huge deal, and is nice if you have a lot of programs you want run in Japanese, but like I said, it might mess with a few things.
			Once it's been changed, you can just run the .exe normally and it should run correctly.
