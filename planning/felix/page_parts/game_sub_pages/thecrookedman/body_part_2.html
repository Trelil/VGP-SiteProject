			Fight the Crooked Man; he takes 20 hits. Also, the energy drink can be used as a healing item.
			There are several cheap methods for the desperate.<br />
			1. If you get him on the top side of a desk and you on the bottom, you can safely hit him from across the desk. (The opposite won't work.)<br />
			2. If you pause the game, you can still attack by pressing Z. Pause when he's in front of you, highlight an unusable item, attack 20 times, and when you unpause, he'll die. Be careful not to go over or he'll become unbeatable.<br />
			3. Lastly, you can leave the room and come back in to always get him in the same position for easy attacking. Probably the easiest and cheapest.
